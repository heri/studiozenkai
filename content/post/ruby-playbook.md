I was introduced to the idea of playbook, which is basically a recipe to win a case. It can be in a team sports situation, such as how to score in American football in a given situation. It can be used by a salesperson, such as how to win a commercial contract.

I imagined what would be my Ruby Engineering playbook:

* Focus on hard projects that move the needle, or alternatively easy wins
* Do not reinvent the wheel. Research before trying to come up with your design
* Have a log(n) or faster implementation, as if you had a CPU from last century
* Do as little changes as possible, as if keystrokes were a limited resource, and copy/paste did not exist
* You should be able to explain your design or algorithm orally to another person, without them able to see any code
* Do not create side-effects in other people's work. Assume future maintainers won't be smart so make your implementation idiot-proof
* Before committing, ask if it is the best you can commit
* Increase test coverage
* Always run linting & test suite before commit.
