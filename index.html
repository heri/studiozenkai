                            and create new innovative electronics.
                            A few metro stations away from downtown Montreal, Foulab is located in an industrial
                            building, the kind you would expect to see hosting a rave party. Before coming to Foulab,
                            you’ll see a studio for artists:
                            Fiercely independent, Foulab is not sponsored by any government or corporation. It’s run by
                            its members, in a way similar to coops.

                            A convoy of truckers gathered in Canada&rsquo;s federal capital last week. They protested
                            vaccine mandates but rode on a wave of discontentment against lockdown, inflation and more.
                            Many right-leaning Canadians value their &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to do what they want, above
                            general public health. They state that they will build immunity naturally and let covid19
                            run its course. This is on top of a belief that distrust anything from government &amp;
                            institutions.

                            I was introduced to the idea of playbook, which is basically a recipe to win a case. It can
                            be in a team sports situation, such as how to score in American football in a given
                            situation. It can be used by a salesperson, such as how to win a commercial contract.
                            I imagined what would be my Ruby Engineering playbook:
                            Focus on hard projects that move the needle in the long-term, or alternatively easy wins
                            (less than a day to implement+deploy) Do not reinvent the wheel.

                            Docker Desktop is one of the de facto tool present on macos developer machines, along with
                            other utilities such as git or homebrew. Contrary to apps such as VS Code, it not an app you
                            interact with everyday but more a background tool running constantly during application
                            development and deployment. It runs in fact the virtual machine that allows you to run
                            docker on Windows or Mac as if you were on Linux, albeit with a little bit more resources.

                            In Canada, as well as many countries, Covid-19 infections is exponentially decreasing.
                            We are on the verge of getting our old life back, from going to restaurants or to the
                            cinemas, and why not have a celebratory drink with friends.
                            Before moving on, I would like to share how I remote work, one of the main traits of the
                            Covid-19 pandemic. I hope this helps other remote workers, and encourage developers and
                            companies to adopt it on a permanent basis.

                            I decided this morning to cancel my Amazon Prime membership. I used it for free prime
                            delivery, and also for occasional prime videos, such as the excellent Elementary series. It
                            is also amazing to say &ldquo;Alexa, play french songs&rdquo; and discover pieces from
                            Amazon Music you knew nothing about.
                            I used to be a fan of the Amazon store. You could find rare items that were not sold
                            anywhere else, at unbeatable prices.

                            Today is Earth day and an excellent opportunity to reflect on human&rsquo;s environmental
                            impact.
                            The pandemic hit countries like a truck and changed overnight our ways of working or
                            interacting with others. Many lost their jobs, others went into depression or worse got
                            infected with COVID-19.
                            The origin of the disease was little discussed. It is clear for me though that human&rsquo;s
                            cancerous growth, especially deforestation, is linked to the pandemic.

                            How do you diagnose a slow web application? What about an unresponsive web application?
                            Those are questions I asked when interviewing recently developers. The questions are simple
                            to understand yet complex to answer. Many applicants study data structures or various
                            algorithms. Few have a holistic view of web applications, due to lack of experience or
                            because of niche specializations. They often work on a specific part of a web project, and
                            have little appreciation of work done in back-end, front-end, devops or other areas.

                            One year ago, I decided to purchase a waterfront cottage. It would be in the Laurentians aka
                            Quebec&rsquo;s cottage country.
                            In December and early January 2020, Twitter alerted me to the sanitary situation in China.
                            It was clear it was coming this way. Since authorities didn&rsquo;t seem to care, I thought
                            it would be a complete disaster in North America, with the economy and infrastructure
                            paralyzed. I also knew the stock market has been bullish for the past decade and bet it
                            would crash.
