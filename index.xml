&lt;p&gt;Aimable D. is a close friend since our engineering school days. Like me, he spent time in the corporate world. Bu he has also done multiple ventures, from eCommerce to corporate to consumer ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he is focused on &lt;a href=&#34;http://dokomaps.com&#34;&gt;dokomaps&lt;/a&gt;. I am reviewing today Dokomaps to provide feedback, to showcase a good product, but also in the hope that Aimable reviews one of my current ventures, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://outcomereference.com&#34;&gt;OutcomeReference&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pitch&#34;&gt;The Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please take the time to visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dokomaps.com&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. It describes well what you get. Signing up is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I get from it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dokomaps lets you favorite places, local or international, in personal lists. The list can be for personal use, but they are designed to be shared to the widest audience. Think &amp;ldquo;TOP 10 BEER PLACES&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Top vacations places&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose is simple and will resonate in most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created two lists. The first is &lt;a href=&#34;https://dokomaps.com/home/map/176&#34;&gt;Montreal for kids&lt;/a&gt;, divided in the outdoor and indoor categories. The second is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dokomaps.com/home/map/29&#34;&gt;Montreal tech map&lt;/a&gt;. Creating those two lists were quick. I was able to add any place I could think of. The application finds the geographical coordinates, pictures and then zooms the map on the places. You can also re-order places, so I assume the first ranked place is the best of the category. Is this great or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-value&#34;&gt;The Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate value is sharing those lists and getting feedback from friends/family about places I&amp;rsquo;ve missed. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any other app that provides this now. Or a Google Maps option somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wishlist&#34;&gt;Wishlist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered that visitors who don&amp;rsquo;t have an account need to register and sign-up. I doubt friends or family will easily sign up. I trust Aimable so I gave my email but everyone is worried about spam these days. I wish there was an option to make a list public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who&amp;rsquo;ve signed up can have an option to comment or add their feedback on the list. Otherwise the &amp;ldquo;conversation&amp;rdquo; will migrate outside Dokomaps, such as Facebook or Twitter, which is too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wish there was an option to mark a place as done. For example, if I plan to visit X places, I can use dokomaps and check every place as soon as I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final point, I really like this venture. It&amp;rsquo;s always refreshing to see a new take that&amp;rsquo;s not done by Google or Facebook, and knowing your data won&amp;rsquo;t be analyzed, ingested and then sold back to you. If Google was doing this, they would know even more about you than you did, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>48 Hours Climate Change hackathon</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/hackathon-challenge/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I am participating this weekend in the AI Climate Change &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/443903349789312/&#34;&gt;Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;, and I will jot down here my notes and progress. Here is the event pitch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Join us along with the other talented and diverse participants, supported by leading mentors in their fields who will come together to collaborate to attempt to address climate change and its impacts on communities and ecosystems. We hope to begin to achieve real positive impact in 48 hours using AI. We are also announcing 4 AI challenges: Plant Village Challenge, Extreme Weather Prediction, Climate-Related Risk Assessment, and Predict the Weather in Montréal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a recipe to attract ecologists, students, and dreamers alike. It tells very little about technologies, specific goals and metrics, or  datasets, which are key in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverthless, it should be a good opportunity to implement an idea I had recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I used the iOS app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gyrosco.pe&#34;&gt;Gyroscope&lt;/a&gt;, which excels in giving a picture of your daily health. The app has good integration with data providers like Garmin or Apple Health. It was also good at recognizing activities such as walking, biking or taking public transit. At the end of the day, an elegant screen shows total energy expenditure, heart rates, sleep patterns and other core metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brainhub.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gyroscope-famous-react-native-app.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Health tracking with gyroscope&#34; title=&#34;Health tracking with gyroscope&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitness apps are good into telling you if your work-out was good, but Gyroscope was great into showing if you were getting healthier, overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s this ability to track daily actions and giving you a 10,000 feet global view that I want to render, in the case of climate change. Imaging taking an Uber, then getting your Starbucks, having a hamburger at lunch later, then finally biking home. The app will then sum up in a screen what are the positive/negative impact of these actions. You can then share this on social media or just bask in what you&amp;rsquo;ve done that day :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can even imagine, that given enough users and patterns, you could be recommended specific products or actions that improves your &amp;ldquo;climate change balance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if it sounds like I am a green die-hard activist &amp;ndash; I am not at all. This is just 48 hours of my time trying to build an app that can give key information to people in their life, so they can decide what&amp;rsquo;s best for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a bit of background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did &lt;a href=&#34;http://outcomereference.com&#34;&gt;outcomereference&lt;/a&gt;, which is able to correlate a food to diseases, and vice-versa. This project is still a work in progress, as it needs more precise statistical modeling, a course that was in my bottom priorities in engineering. But above all, it works and you can trust the results in any page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DIY-Robocars-Montreal-Meetup-Autonomous-cars-race/&#34;&gt;built a couple of self-driving&lt;/a&gt; RC vehicles, based on the donkeycar open source project. So I can do supervised learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also did a lot of AI modeling to know that you have to be either lucky or have an army of supervisers to get an accurate AI model. In 98% of cases, reverting to regressions, mathematical modeling, or brute-forcing with a database works better than an &amp;ldquo;AI model&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a dozen of web apps, back-end, API or full-stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can do design and UI but it will generally be poor. I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for slick designs so will need help on this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, I foresee a few problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the datasets? and if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any supplied, where do we get them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you actually use an accurate AI model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the metrics for positive/negative climate change actions? I can think of CO2, but it can be also CH4, or harmful substances (pesticides) and plastics generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you present something that&amp;rsquo;s simple and elegant for everyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there even time to train a model and get an accurate model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are data, back-end, design challenges and I hope to write down here the challenges, analysis, the range of solutions and the course taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued. If you want to contact, I&amp;rsquo;m on twitter @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/heri&#34;&gt;heri&lt;/a&gt; or heri [at] studiozenkai.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-13-sep-6pm&#34;&gt;Friday 13 Sep - 6pm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshua Bengio outlines how A.I. can be used, specifically optimizing operations of heavy industry or governments. I think he refers to work done at Element.AI, a commercial entity which works with big businesses. There is no mention of invididual or consumer applications. He also mentions climate and weather modeling, although I am not sure how this can be done in 48 hours. The other presenter, Sasha Luccioni, discusses the actual climate costs of Machine Learning work, and various applications with G.A.N. (??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a random guy who talks about hugging trees and children and taking a sabbatical leave :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also the first time I go to the MILA / Element.AI building and it reminds me of Facebook/Google/Apple campuses. The building has a surprisingly massive footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my side, I am &lt;em&gt;searching public datasets&lt;/em&gt; that could be used, freely or with a license. &lt;a href=&#34;https://coolclimate.org/calculator&#34;&gt;CoolClimate&lt;/a&gt; has a calculator that uses CO2 for climate change costs with categories in travel, home, food and shopping. It would be possible to deduce activity costs with this calculator, and get sparse data that could be used as a foundation for the app. Another &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.footprintcalculator.org&#34;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; has a better design for everyday users, however it would be hard to &amp;ldquo;reverse engineer&amp;rdquo; this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecological_Footprint&#34;&gt;various papers&lt;/a&gt; in ecological footprints but with my experience with outcomereference, I know these would take forever to read, assimilate and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also reading an extensive &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdp.net/en/investor/ghg-emissions-dataset&#34;&gt;study modeling GHG production&lt;/a&gt; and their statistical framework. I think there are some very good lessons here for consumer/invidual applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found a few datasets such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenAMEE/datasets&#34;&gt;OpenAMEE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Mzkarim/Exploring--CO2-Emission-Data-&#34;&gt;CO2 Emissions data&lt;/a&gt; . The first one by OpenAMEE and various forks is especially interesting. I will have to look into the scientific validation of the dataset tomorrow but it is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point however, it is clear there is no extensive public database of ecological footprint of your daily actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part of the challenge was &lt;em&gt;finding metrics&lt;/em&gt; to qualify daily actions. Interestingly, the CoolClimate calculator seems to correlate all activities with CO2 production. Isn&amp;rsquo;t using CO2 simplistic? Or is it really a standard? I hope I meet a climate change specialist to confirm or deny this tomorrow. Personally, I see &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; as one of the many modern issues that needs to be tackled. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that pesticides, radioactivity or microplastics contribute to climate change for instance, but I see them as important plagues that need action. I might go againt the grain, but I would even rather see climate change rather than having our lands filled with microplastics and chemicals everywhere. Or maybe, CO2, CH4, harmful chemicals can be different components and responses, much alike calories, sleep patterns and mindset are presented in different screens in Gyroscope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the social side, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of positive responses from good folks like Nicole Fu, on the other side of the ocean. She&amp;rsquo;s working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://thecrowd.charity&#34;&gt;The Crowd&lt;/a&gt; app, which compels you to pledge positive climate change. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look into this tomorrow am. I&amp;rsquo;ve got also good support on Twitter and Facebook. This is great and a sign that we are going in a good direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 7:30pm however and family duty calls. I&amp;rsquo;m wrapping this up and will be here tomorrow 9AM sharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-13-sep-late-night-brainstorming&#34;&gt;Friday 13 Sep - Late Night Brainstorming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have given some thoughts on the footprintcalculator.org design, linked above. They do not tell you figures but rather tell you how many Earths would be needed to support your activities. I like this idea, as this is easy to explain to people, even outside climate change communities, and can also be illustrated elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drive an SUV, eat red meat daily, spend thousands on plastic stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t need =&amp;gt; 4.5 Earths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk/Bike, produce your own veggies, work remotely =&amp;gt; 0.3 Earths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenAMEE dataset mentioned earlier is also interesting, as it would be straightforward to map into a hierarchical database, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;root activity
__ Transport activity 1.2 Earths
      __ walking 0.02 Earths (or CO2 metric)
      __ biking 0.25 Earths
      __ public transport (subway, electric) 0.85 Earths
      __ public transport (bus, gas) 1.1 Earths
      __ electric car 1.6 Earths
      __ ICE car 2.3 Earths
      __ SUV 3.5 Earths
      __ flying Boeing Dreamliner 7.5 Earths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could sort siblings at the same level to get the min and max ecological footprint, the median, and also showcase alternative(s). For example, if you take the subway, the app could tell you that walking would have a lower ecological footprint but it would be definitively better than taking a truck for the same trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell me yet how machine learning could be used. I could use Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html&#34;&gt;Open Images V5&lt;/a&gt; to categorize pictures of activities uploaded. Or maybe do some NLP. This is hard right now to answer because datasets and outputs are not clear. It would be good if a machine learning researcher could look into this tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-14-sep-design-phase&#34;&gt;Saturday 14 Sep - Design phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a tentative mockup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/hackathon-mockup.png&#34; alt=&#34;mockup&#34; title=&#34;[hackathon mockup]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could add a picture of their flight. He can add flight duration, and then carbon intensity estimation is shown. This is added as one of his activity. At the end of the day, on the right side, a graph made up of his activities represents his &amp;ldquo;carbon map&amp;rdquo;. This is the key take-away from the app - knowing first what are the impact of each of your activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user does not enter any input, it is assumed his choices is similar to the baseline, i.e. other people in his city for transport, food, shopping and activities (work, entertainment etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if it could connect to Alexa Smart Home, and deduce your energy consumption, cooking and other activities. Or it could tap into Garmin and many other popular data providers to provide better estimations. Machine Learning could be used further on top to improve carbon footprint estimations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think so far? Head over to Twitter or email me. I&amp;rsquo;d love to discuss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-14-sep-discussions-and-first-code-lines&#34;&gt;Saturday 14 Sep - Discussions and first code lines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to many people both online and offline, and the general consensus is that this project needs design, from how to ask for user inputs, to how to show information that does not demotivcate users. For example, somebody who is trying to make change in their life might feel discouraged by seeing the amounts of CO2 he generated recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmrowco/tmrowapp-contrib&#34;&gt;tmrow&lt;/a&gt; has been working on this issue for the past 3 years with a solid danish/french team. They have a mobile app and a community base. You can contribute calculations and data to the repository linked earlier. The application is not publicly available so it does limit the usefulness of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry from &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecrowd.charity&#34;&gt;the Crowd Charity&lt;/a&gt; responded a lot of questions regarding datasets and also climate change practices. I feel privileged getting this information and hope to bring back with good work to the community in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now less than 24 hours from Demo time in Montreal. Due to this time constraint, I have decided to build an API-based service where third-parties like The Crowd or other can query the carbon cost of various activities. So far, transport  category is covered, with data coming from OpenAMEE and calculations methods based on OpenAMEE sources. If there is no data for a category, the algorithm will look into children categories and get the median cost. All that&amp;rsquo;s left for the user is inputting the number of km for the transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/hackathon-transport.png&#34; alt=&#34;transport&#34; title=&#34;[hackathon mockup]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not foresee having a front-end tomorrow as I will have to work on the other categories such as food, personal, home and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun-15-sep-final-and-wrap-up&#34;&gt;Sun 15 Sep - Final and Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in most hackathons, there was a severe lack of time towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded mechanically and did some major copy/pasting for data, as well as bulk csv import 🧟&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application allows you to add your activity, one after the other. It will take the CO2 produced and apply a multiplier. It also gets CH4 production and other greenhouse gas, plus also required energy. There are &amp;ldquo;stochiometry ratios&amp;rdquo; to get the equivalent CO2 for any CH4 produced, as well as public data on CO2 produced per kwH depending on your current location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/hackathon-final.png&#34; alt=&#34;final&#34; title=&#34;[hackathon final]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the app sets the location to Canada. Here is a breakdown for these few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cycling does not produce greenhouse gases. This is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mini-bus activity was for 3 hours at 80kmh. The app calculates the distance and then divide by the number of participants to get 3.617 kg CO2. This is not bad as most people will produce more by driving their car in Canada for 3 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are various activities like washing machine and watching TV. We convert the energy required to CO2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biggest culprit here is Dairy Cattle. Effectively, raising dairy cattle completely annihilates any climate change efforts. Dairy cattle produce a huge amount of CH4 and CH4 has a high CO2 ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering-wise, I did not do unfortunately any unit or functional testing. I hate myself but it was about having something up in 30mn vs having something well-engineered. Fortunately, all the calculations and mathematical modeling made sense. I cross-referenced with a few other public calculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other teams presented a working mobile app. I found it amazing that they would be able to work and get an accurate model, as well as build an Android or an iOS app. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have time to do some css. I remember a few years ago teams would struggle even to get a single web app working. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested (holla or tweet at @heri), I can put this online as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-16-sep-future&#34;&gt;Monday 16 Sep - Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next? To make this usable, the service needs to be tied to various data providers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MyFitnessPal logs your food. If I can connect to their API, I can associate each ingredient to their carbon footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would need to find a trusted service that logs your car trips and your flights, plus the type of car driven. This needs research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are popular fitness trackers such as Fitbit, Garmin or Google Fit that logs your bike and walking trips. This can be integrated and show your carbon intensity (or lack thereof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It looks like due to privacy reasons, there is no public API for Smart Homes. I could be wrong, but there is no way for example to list what are your smart appliances and when they run with Alexa Home, or the Google/Apple equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these data providers would be a much more seamless experience for potential users, since they get immediate results, and potentially immediate recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love also to sit down with a climate change scientist to validate calculations. Plus good design people and marketing. Damn, that sounds like a team &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll share this on social networks and see where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchlab.ai&#34;&gt;MTLNewTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchlab.ai&#34;&gt;AI Launch Lab&lt;/a&gt; who have organized the hackathon. I know from first hand how much dedication it takes to create such an event spanning several days. The food was delicious, coffee was plenty and there was a good diversity of attendees. A special holla to Ilias Benjeloun who gave his 120% and came the whole 3 days, even though he got a cold towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building an autonomous RC car</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/autonomous-rc-car/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 12:00:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://studiozenkai.com/post/autonomous-rc-car/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on article that encourages you to experiment and see what works on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shameless Promotion&lt;/em&gt;: If you are in Montréal, I (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/heri&#34;&gt;@heri&lt;/a&gt;) do a meetup where people interested in computer vision, AI, robotics work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DIY-Robocars-Montreal-Meetup-Autonomous-cars-race&#34;&gt;autonomous cars&lt;/a&gt;. Please drop by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-rc-car&#34;&gt;Why a RC car?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like developing an application, my recommendation is to build first a &lt;em&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/em&gt; (MVP). Then iterate it quickly from there towards a version that works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An autonomous car is at the bare minimum able to follow a course, without any input from a human driver. That is an engineering challenge, both on the hardware and software side. The car manufacturer needs to install a wide array of sophisticated sensors, ranging from cameras, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar&#34;&gt;LIDAR&lt;/a&gt;, GPS to engine sensors. It also requires actuators so a computer can drive the engine, gears and steering. The software has to ingest a huge flow of data, decide on the best route based on missing or conflicting data, and make sure not to harm anything in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These constraints means making a autonomous car is costly and prohibitive for most. If you want to build a life-sized self-driving car, you need to join a team at Waymo, Baidu, Yandex or another billion dollar company like Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;hack&lt;/em&gt; is to work on an RC car, instead of a life-size car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RC cars are plenty available. The smartphone and drones boom means there are plenty of cheap and diverse sensors and parts usable for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RC cars are also light, which means an accident will not create body injury. If a part breaks, you can replace it easily and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, RC cars can have simpler autonomous software. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a mission planner. Object tracking is not necessary. The MVP can just have track recognition. This is good news for those who want to study computer vision or neural networks, without being a specialist in hardware, mapping, motion planning or in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means development costs and times are cut down. Instead of months and years, you could have your first autonomous in a few weeks time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;anatomy-of-an-autonomous-rc-car&#34;&gt;Anatomy of an autonomous RC car&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An autonomous RC car mirrors a life-size car, with simpler parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A main motor with a transmission,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A battery,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one ESC or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_speed_control&#34;&gt;Electronic Speed Controller&lt;/a&gt;. The ESC will run the motor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.servocity.com/what-is-a-servo&#34;&gt;servo&lt;/a&gt;, for steering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensor. At the bare minimum, you will need one wide-angle camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer or equivalent to record, run inference based on data from sensor and send outputs to the servo and ESC. A Raspberry Pi is good for the first version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A RC transmitter/Receiver. Instead, you will use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output&#34;&gt;GPIO pins&lt;/a&gt; of a Raspberry pi to send signals to the ESC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A RC body. Electronics should be easily accessible and replaceable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A gearbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn signals (blinkers), brakes or headlights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a GPU card or TPUs, at least not in the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the software side, a RC car has a main python program that decides what to do next based on image recorded. Here, you can use either machine learning (Deep Learning/CNN/Tensorflow/&lt;a href=&#34;https://keras.io/&#34;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;) or traditional computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For computer vision, the best way to start is with &lt;a href=&#34;http://openmv.io&#34;&gt;OpenMV.io&lt;/a&gt;. The camera has a board that will do the calculations such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://openmv.io/collections/cams/products/openmv-cam-m7&#34;&gt;line detection&lt;/a&gt;, contrast/exposure changes. In the case of an autonomous car using CV such as Teslas, it will use a basic technique called &amp;ldquo;blob tracking&amp;rdquo; that shows a center point, which tells the car how to steer to stay on the line. See the code and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://diyrobocars.com/2018/11/23/updated-minimal-viable-racer-to-use-latest-openmv-linear-regression-code/&#34;&gt;DIY Robocar post here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s less sophisticated and less &lt;em&gt;trendy&lt;/em&gt; than machine learning, but produces good results as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For machine learning, the application will have at its core a convolutional neural network taught with supervised learning. This means the neural network is trained on an external computer using image frames from the RC camera and then run the inference model on the edge computer to generate the corresponding outputs to the servo and the motor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very similar to computational photography on Huawei or Google phones. Engineers took a variety of images from the camera, annotated parts of the image that should be blurry (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh&#34;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt; ). Each user can then produce portraits with bokeh on their phone, based on the model trained in the previous step. But instead of motor signals, it produces bokeh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is fortunately the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.donkeycar.com&#34;&gt;Donkeycar&lt;/a&gt; project that has ready-to-use software and hardware instructions. There are links to find the appropriate parts, and if you are stuck, there is also an active community on Slack. There are also good projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/RyanZotti/Self-Driving-Car&#34;&gt;RyanZotti&lt;/a&gt; which works well for smaller RC cars and Lego, the Udacity stack or Apollo. However, Donkeycar is the most usable and beginner-friendly in my opinion. You don&amp;rsquo;t need soldiering and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a lot of extra electronics to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you combine the hardware and software and want to launch your first RC autonomous car, the process is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put together a track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect through SSH to the Raspberry Pi, and then access driving controls on the web, or with a controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to drive a few laps, like what a real good driver would do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once you are sure of your driving skills, begin recording laps. All image frames and inputs (throttle, steering angle) will be recorded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transfer training data to the main computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training is done typically on a beefy computer with a recent Nvidia card, or otherwise on a cloud server with a GPU (Google Compute or Amazon). The loss value represents the difference between what the neural network computes and what would be an ideal output. You will want to minimize this, without overfitting the model. Once you&amp;rsquo;re happy with a loss value, you can validate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the trained model with your RC car, and race it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t done neural networks, this is a great way to understand how it works, and perhaps have your first AI application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that is the Minimum Viable Product. Other developments could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use instead an Nvidia Jetson board. This is much more powerful, and better suited for machine learning. Models can be trained and run directly on the board, without requiring an external computer with GPU. You can add easily multiple cameras, speed sensors, LIDAR, GPS without any issues, and run at the same time a mission planner. However it consumes significantly more power compared to a Raspberry Pi, costs at least x5 more, and takes so much space that you will have to upgrade to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; RC car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a good driver of RC cars, or become a very good driver. Because after all, A.I. only learns from your inputs. This is what most people forget. Everyone wants to buy more expensive cameras, or just write more code. Often, models are fed garbage. It can be only as good as you are. This is why big corporations like Waymo require driver trainers with a &lt;em&gt;spotless&lt;/em&gt; driving history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve electronic parts so the RC car becomes more precise and more responsive. Often, RC cars have too much torque, imprecise steering, and also have a delay compared to life-size cars,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_steering&#34;&gt;differential steering&lt;/a&gt;. It can be a RC tracked vehicle, or a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover&#34;&gt;Mars Rover&lt;/a&gt;-style robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the machine learning model. You can track &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/arxiv_cscv&#34;&gt;arXiv CV&lt;/a&gt;, and check out recent self-driving or computer vision papers. You can then try to implement the algorithm presented, if there is minimal code. You can work on reinforcement learning, data augmentation, use different kernel size, lens correction, sensor fusion etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add actuators. For example, add a loader, or snowplow system. For example, this guy developed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackster.io/abdullahsadiq/autonomous-delivery-system-4c2048&#34;&gt;a package delivery system&lt;/a&gt; based on the donkeycar! Isn&amp;rsquo;t that amazing? Now you can have your $100m VC funded startup with open source electronics :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add sensors for better depths perception, for example to prevent collisions. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1125.html&#34;&gt;LIDARs for $99&lt;/a&gt;. Or add an IMU (angle/orientation sensor), add a GPS, beacon system etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add obstacles, small pedestrians models, traffic lights, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the knowledge and extend it to autonomous boats, rockets, planes. There are competitions for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.herox.com/alphapilot&#34;&gt;autonomous flight drones&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate more complex autonomous software such as Autoware or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo&#34;&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and make it run a complex command. Such as go pickup package at point A, go to point B, wait for a signal, then park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://roboticsmasters.co/fullsizecars/&#34;&gt;autonomous car kits&lt;/a&gt; for real cars. Another kit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/commaai/openpilot&#34;&gt;running openpilot&lt;/a&gt; is provided by comma.ai for recent Toyota/Honda cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly suggest taking a lean approach. Do step by step improvements, save every model you&amp;rsquo;ve validated. It&amp;rsquo;s better to have regular small improvements than try to go big and then fail big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are around, we&amp;rsquo;d love to have you at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DIY-Robocars-Montreal-Meetup-Autonomous-cars-race/events/259007280/&#34;&gt;our next meetup this wednesday Feb 27&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://diyrobocars.com/local-meetup-groups/&#34;&gt;check other meetups near you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All I want for Christmas is a small phone</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/small-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 12:00:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://studiozenkai.com/post/small-phone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an iPhone 6S Plus a few years ago. I was impressed by the screen, the biggest I’ve had. Look! I can use it as a tablet. Watch videos everywhere, or showcase my latest work at a tech meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dreams shattered in many pieces. I was biking happily, the phone was sticking out of my pocket and crashed to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bike a lot, hike, run around hilly tracks and never cracked a screen before the iPhone 6S Plus. Previous phones could fit in a normal pocket. In an instant, I realized why large screen phones did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the iPhone 6S Plus, electronics manufacturers seems to compete against each other in size. More screen real estate, more cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want big screens anymore. Even today, I do not know how to hold it when I run or exercise. Do you keep it on your hand? Or buy a special attachment and put it on your shoulder? I run for peace of mind, and having a big dangling phone seemed to defeat the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get in a similar akward situation when I meet friends for lunch. When phones are big, you do not want to keep it in a pocket. It finishes on the table. This separates us. The phone becomes a talking point and becomes part of your identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use my phone for two factor authentication. This means the phone is the key for assets worth $10k - or $5k depending on cryptocurrency prices… I don’t want to put such a key asset on a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools I like best are forgettable when I do not use them, are user friendly, and do not require special treatment. And they definitively do not define my behaviour. This is not the case of phones with 6 inches display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for this Christmas, I will go against the grain to want less, not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 inch would be a good size to start with. I could forget in my pants pocket. I could put it in my runner shorts and go run for a couple of hours, without noticing the weight. 6 inches would not fit in those short shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it waterproof, dust-proof and a minimum shock-proof so I don’t have a heart attack when a baby plays with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fingerprint sensor. Please, no face recognition. Showing my face doesn’t mean I want to unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headphone jack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large camera (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.3 to 1”) with computational photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, an expandable phone, such as being able to connect it to a raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don’t want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a phone made of glass or other luxury material. In the real world, a phone falls, is a toy for kids, is covered by sweat when you run, and bumped against coins and metal keys. And it not an object I am willing to replace by the latest trendy gizmo every 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a notch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a phone that costs $1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;an assistant that spies your browsing history, your location or your audio to serve ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this somehow describes an iPhone 5S with an upgraded camera, with the durability of a Nokia 3310. I would get one. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you? Let’s hope a product manager hears this somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking again at Microsoft</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/microsoft/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 12:00:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://studiozenkai.com/post/microsoft/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The natural cycle of companies is to innovate. The flame dies down, then it fights again to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is one of those. Win 3.1 was revolutionary, and so was Win 95. With Win 3.1, you could point and click to start programs. With Windows 95, you could install games with a nice GUI instead of typing arduous commands in MS-DOS. No more failures at the video setup or having to find a driver file for your sound card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, Microsoft went greedy. Instead of optimizing for good products, the mega corporation optimized for dollars. It sued any organization threatening its dominant position. Innovation was adding recycled buttons and rows in Microsoft Office. This was good for shareholders but made everyone’s life worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time I switched to an Apple iBook. The white plastic made it look like a toy, but it “just worked”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; recently. To my surprise, it is a very well built piece of software. I remember Microsoft Visual Studio in engineering school. You needed to be “corporate” to go past the licensing pages, then feel out of place if you didn’t read 500 pages of C#. My initial computer science dreams died there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report VS Code is lightweight and lets you work right away. I have been using it for more than 18 months and have yet to find an issue. It just works. Previous Microsoft products could do everything and nothing. VS Code took courageous design choices so it performs well in the few things it&amp;rsquo;s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, I have 3 to 5 workspaces open at the same time. A workspace has at least two folders, each folder representing an application. That is tens of thousands of javascript, ruby, python, shell, css/html files. I can search and replace a pattern in a 440MB log file, and it will not crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atom.io is a similar code editor from  Github. It also uses Electron. But where VS Code shines, Atom.io chokes up on large javascript files (&amp;gt;1Mb). I am not sure if Atom.io tries to execute the javascript or if it has a weak rendering engine. It is “OK” for editing text files or quick coding, but unproductive for a large project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text is a nice native code editor. But I prefer VS Code&amp;rsquo;s built-in Github integration, workspaces, and extensions. TextMate, another code editor I used for years, also “just works”, but is dated. Now, I only use VS Code and vim for programming, on a Macbook Pro or a Windows or Linux laptop. It even works on Raspbian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VS Code is not an exception. I like the Microsoft Surface hardware line-up. The Surface Book could be a nice Macbook Pro replacement, if Windows had a good Terminal. I haven’t had the chance to try Azure, but I’ve been told it holds up compared to AWS or DigitalOcean, my preferred hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, somebody at Microsoft got people working together and started caring about making their users’ life easier. In other words, they started optimizing for good products, instead of optimizing for dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good things I would love to see to commit fully to Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering fonts and subpixels is sketchy compared to Apple, no matter the screen resolution. Is it possible to get one of your hardware designer to work on this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love if Microsoft (or Apple) made fingerprint profiles. If I use my fingerprint, allow access to all apps and data. If it’s a kid’s fingerprint, disable the App Store, and allow Youtube for a limited time. If it’s not a recognized fingerprint, show a clean desktop, with the rest of the data encrypted. I see computing devices as tools. I can share a tool or a car with a family member, why can’t you do the same with computing devices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Linux Terminal. I would like to use shell scripts, docker in Windows, use ssh and any other tool I use in a Linux/Ubuntu machine. Please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget about telemetry and offer complete privacy by default. We do not want devices that phones home or with back doors. If you treat us as pirates or irresponsible kids, we will become pirates and irresponsible kids. Please trust your users and we will trust you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know you are working on a new browser. For the love of common sense, find a way to solve the GDPR, cookie popups, adtech and privacy abuses. Why can’t we have a browser setting “I accept/I do not accept cookies for all sites”? So it gets rids of all annoying popups. Why don’t we have the browser handle privacy? Browsers should be able to give websites a key to private data information, after a fingerprint confirmation. Once you are finished with a site, you could ask the browser to terminate access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t annoy me with updates and questions. MacOS started asking constantly if it can update software and reboot. This interrupts my workflow and makes me think it is broken. If there is a critical update, and the core software needs to be updated, just do it, without interruption. If it is not a critical update, please give us an option “I will update my software manually” so we do not have to agree to a software update every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Ruby Performance checklist</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/ruby-performance-checklist/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 10:35:26 EDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://studiozenkai.com/post/ruby-performance-checklist/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I shipped many applications, using a variety of frameworks, through &lt;a href=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/challenge/&#34;&gt;my current 1 year challenge&lt;/a&gt; or startups. Ruby issues include low performance, such as servers needing more RAM, not able to sustain large traffic, or slow rendering. Since this is a recurring issue, here is a checklist to help developers get their Ruby app faster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-complexity&#34;&gt;Code complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and ease of use allows beginners and experienced developers alike to ship features in record time. Good for business, otherwise bad for code quality. For instance, many :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create too many instance variables and statements. This means more allocations and more database calls. Often the variables are not even used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add too many loops. This exponentially decreases performance. Do you need yet another &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; or collection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use too many gems. There are many nice gems to make you life easier. Few however think if they need yet another gem. Don&amp;rsquo;t bloat your app!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less complex code is more readable and brings in most cases more performance. I like to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic&#34;&gt;rubycritic&lt;/a&gt; to bring more sanity. Another alternative is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&#34;&gt;rubocop&lt;/a&gt;. There are also third-party services like skylight to show you object allocation. Pick your tool, and focus efforts on the most complex methods. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to write terse one-liners. However there is a always a happy middle ground that will satisfy developers and product owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;database-calls&#34;&gt;Database calls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ActiveRecord or Sequel makes life easier for Ruby developers. Perhaps too easy. If left unchecked, you find yourself doing hundreds of queries for a single page. Get the blog post, get the post comments, then get the comment users, and then their pictures. And why not the list of people who liked, or favorited the post. And&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and easy solution is stop doing N+1 queries. Use a gem like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet&#34;&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt; or a service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoutapp.com/&#34;&gt;scoutapp&lt;/a&gt; to hunt N+1 queries. These allow you to set alert on Slack, or any similar messenging service, in case of a N+1 query. See an alert as a failure that needs to be solved before the end of the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another (and less easy) path is start learning and loving Postgres (or MySQL, if that&amp;rsquo;s your database of choice). This will take time, but you will then be able to start using advanced joins, custom types such as ranges, arrays, json, spatial types, or good full-text searches. Please investigate to make best use of existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;devops-for-ruby&#34;&gt;DevOps for Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have a dedicated DevOps or an infrastructure engineer in your team, I advise generally Ruby developers to learn how to deploy, manage and scale servers. This will allow you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn load balancing or reverse proxy cache. See into Nginx scripting, through Lua or Ruby, to dramatically increase performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how to sustain good performance, even with limited hardware or service disruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn the pros and cons of passenger vs puma vs unicorn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how to commit and deploy without service uninterruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art-of-caching&#34;&gt;The art of caching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caching can be done at multiple levels: front server, database, app, assets etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite is ETag. Everyone wants to use Redis but smart use of etags lets you render pages in 40ms or less. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat. In the example of the blog post, the &lt;code&gt;updated_at&lt;/code&gt; column lets us bypass rendering or data loading. ETag also works for API calls so do not be shy in using ETag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another low-hanging fruit is caching. Most often, rendering a collection with a partial takes most of the time for a page render. Using &lt;code&gt;cached: true&lt;/code&gt; increases performance. Once you have a store for caching, you can also store results of complex queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, Redis will be your best friend. It&amp;rsquo;s stable as a rock, will ingest anything you throw at it, is extensible and super-fast. With a bit of work, you can serve requests from 100kreq/s to 1mreq/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-impression-of-speed&#34;&gt;The impression of speed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say performance is in the eye of beholder. A static page means slow performance for users. However doing the following will make them think otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using frameworks like React allows them to load instantly pages. The visitor can be &amp;ldquo;distracted&amp;rdquo; by a loading animation and/or various parts of the page moving. You can also let them enter data on a form while data loads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On select browsers such as Chrome or Firefox, service workers let users continue using the page, even if the server is slow or even unreachable. Performance is then only related to the performance of the front-end app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplement data can be loaded later. In the example of the article, we get the page title and content text in one query. However, comments can be loaded only when the user scrolls down to the relevant section. In a similar way, you can defer content requiring heavy calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other UI patterns to give the impression of speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;offloading&#34;&gt;Offloading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business goals might require a maximum render time. In this case, you can offload complex processing to a job server, most often Sidekiq/Redis. You can for example use this job server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To send emails and notify users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To work on the database, such as calculations, data processing, data import and export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To process media, such as encoding videos, resizing images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and generally any job that might slow down your main app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawback is that a job might fail. Or data might have changed between the job creation and job processing. Sidekiq is also not as reliable as Redis. Overall, data offloading might confuse users by presenting obsolete data - leading them to reload pages, spam customer service, or just quit. Make sure to test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sub-optimization&#34;&gt;Sub-optimization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have done all the above, with lean methods, smart use of caching, and a good UI, I might still be unsatisfied with Ruby performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to optimize key parts of your application by using C or Rust code. For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamSaffron/fast_blank&#34;&gt;fast_blank&lt;/a&gt; gem makes blank? statements 20x faster. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ohler55/oj&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;oj&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; is a JSON parser written in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/danielpclark/faster_path&#34;&gt;faster_path&lt;/a&gt;, written in Rust, can optimize file loading. There is a also the newer &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tildeio/helix&#34;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; gem, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested yet, to easily add Rust to your Rails application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to test extensively (esp. unit tests)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-you-really-need-rails&#34;&gt;Do you really need Rails?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies dealing with poor Ruby performance use Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is a heavyweight, the hungry yokozuna that will eat any available RAM. Yet in many cases, we don&amp;rsquo;t need all the Active Support methods or everything that Active Record gives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda&#34;&gt;roda&lt;/a&gt;, a micro Ruby framework, is faster than Phoenix, Play (a scala framework) and can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/previews/round14/#section=data-r14&amp;amp;hw=ph&amp;amp;test=query&#34;&gt;as fast as nodejs&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&#34;http://hanamirb.org/&#34;&gt;Hanami&lt;/a&gt; is another framework that will deliver superior performance compared to Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ve used a standalone Roda app or Hanami, in parallel to a Rails app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;json search results for the application. roda outputs a db query to json. These are sent to a React/Angular front-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embedding content. Bloggers and users looking to embed an object on their site or social media are served by roda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building a simple/minimalistic admin area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also used other frameworks such as Phoenix framework or in rare occasions Lapis (which uses OpenResty/nginx) or ExpressJs. Phoenix lies on top of the Erlang VM and is almost impossible to kill. Scheduling background processing jobs is nice experience compared to Rails - stress-free and more natural. However the language is not as expressive as Ruby and you find yourself writing more lines (!). Like Phoenix, Lapis is another high-performance framework written in Lua, however the community is quite small. You can also check out golang frameworks such as beego. Not bad, however I would use a go framework only on select projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, it is hard to write a definitive performance guide that will work for most applications. A few applications require just a bit of front-end UI work solve all performance issues (i.e. add a spinner gif and everyone&amp;rsquo;s happy). Others require hand-crafted SQL queries. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just about beefing up server hardware. Use tools like scout-apm, skylight or newrelic. Work on the low-hanging fruits and then move up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for performance ideas, I advise taking one of your legacy apps and try to increase performance by 3x or 10x within a 48H hackathon. This exercise will force you to work on creative solutions and will teach you valuable technics for working applications later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note : This on-going article will be updated and extended regularly. Make sure to come back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their multiplication of AirBnb, Kickstarter and Uber clones in recent years have encouraged entrepreneurs to launch their own marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one hand, you entice merchants selling their products &amp;amp; services and on the other hand, you encourage visitors to come and buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the most difficult ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchants are hard to convince if there are no buyers, and vice-versa. It&amp;rsquo;s the definition of a chicken and egg problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a marketplace successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of dry guides that are hard inspiring and leaves nothing to the imagination, I like to compare with the nascent wool marketplace in Ken Follet&amp;rsquo;s excellent &amp;ldquo;The Pillars of the Earth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/earth.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; title=&#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a gripping epic set in the middle ages, filled with human tales, genius and evil. The wool marketplace thrives in the Pillars thanks to a combination of :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;routes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;relic,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;city,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;emissaries,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;annual fair,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and good rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;routes&#34;&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle ages, marketplaces appeared at the intersection of trafficked routes: roads, bridges, rivers, ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A toll bridge forces merchants to wait. Soon, a few would decide to exchange goods while waiting for entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/toll.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;road toll&#34; title=&#34;road toll&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more routes, the better for the marketplace. If there are a couple of roads, a port, a toll bridge and a city, then a marketplace would thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if routes have fluidity, such as an intersection of well-paved roads, there would be hardly a marketplace. Congestion create opportunities to meet for merchants or buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Internet, &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; are the different paths internet visitors take during their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a marketplace owner, your role is to create those routes. Even better, you can &lt;strong&gt;position your marketplace at the intersection of existing and well-trafficked routes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, users go back and forth search engines, email, media sites and blogs, social media, eCommerce sites and more. Those are the main routes you need to position your marketplace on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/traffic_internet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;routes internet 2016&#34; title=&#34;routes internet 2016&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can place yourself on the Google search route with Adwords. This is done by all established marketplaces such as eBay or Amazon, and should be studied. SEO work can further augment this route, but takes persistence and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, it is important to create &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;congestion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; within this flow. Visitors will &amp;ldquo;accidentally&amp;rdquo; go through your products, before they go on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add in a Twitter route. For example, a triathlon marketplace can contact or advertise to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/worldtriathlon/followers?lang=en&#34;&gt;followers of the International Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt;. This can be efficient if you can sort the twitter users based on their biography and their tweets, and communicate in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, Facebook offers advertising solutions, based on users profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic placement in a trusted blog can bring visitors with good intent. It is possible your marketplace brings amazing value for the blog&amp;rsquo;s readers, such as a free resource or utility on your site. For example, a 10 pages guide on how to do glamour portraits on your photography marketplace can be linked from a photo blog. Those qualified and trusting visitors will be most likely to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;relic&#34;&gt;Relic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ken Follet&amp;rsquo;s epic, a relic revered by Christians brings believers from far away. It&amp;rsquo;s a small piece, but it is unique and appeals to the power of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/buzz_relic.png&#34; alt=&#34;relic&#34; title=&#34;relic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe a marketplace will only thrive if &lt;strong&gt;there is something worth talking about&lt;/strong&gt;. It can be provocative, crazy, unique, or difficult to own/share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing a copycat, there is hardly a reason for anyone to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber is a great example, by creating heated discussions in cities around the world. Even those who have never taken taxis before feel obliged to delve into the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon often have crazy ideas, such as Dash Buttons that will deliver commodities at the touch of a button or drone deliveries. It does not matter if Amazon will do one day drone delivery. Yet, it fascinates press and bloggers, and gets Amazon in the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your saint relic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fair&#34;&gt;Fair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routes and a relic will drive natural traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is possible to boost growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Pillars of the Earth&amp;rdquo;, an annual fair brings traders as far as Southern Europe and buyers from across the Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fair has selected merchants with amazing merchandise as well as rich buyers, squeezed into one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/gargiulo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;annual wool marketplace the pillars of the earth&#34; title=&#34;annual wool marketplace the pillars of the earth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In online marketplaces, fairs can be &lt;strong&gt;special, time-limited promotions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good example is Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s yearly single sales day, totaling $9.3 billions. The event is promoted heavily online and offline with creative marketing. Special discounts are arranged with top brands such as Xiaomi. And there are of course FREE shipping and lots of amazing specials. Alibaba advertises that stocks are sold out in minutes during the single day, therefore creating a rush effect where buyers try to get any good deal on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you do something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emissaries&#34;&gt;Emissaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emissaries are sent all over Europe prior the fair to guarantee the arrival of traders and buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/town-crier.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Emissary announcing marketplace and fair&#34; title=&#34;Emissary announcing marketplace and fair&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same manner, you can work on a well coordinated PR push to make sure all media and blogs cover your event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also target popular conferences such as CES, SXSW and events popular in your trade. These usually have journalists, youtubers and bloggers hungry for news. Make sure to grab the headlines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-rules&#34;&gt;Good rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All above are good for a marketplace. Yet without security and order, it is just a shiny place to rob buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust and security are the foundations of a marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;. A marketplace would not be sustainable over the years without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchants need to be selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only qualified products from merchants can be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offenders risk heavy fines and there is a prompt response from the marketplace manager in case of misbehavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchants and products are presented cleanly and in a professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a general feeling of security in going around the marketplace, with third-party checks, transaction security, and walls demanding strict authentication before entering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the infrastructure is stable and tested regularly for any bugs or attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules are a priority for the marketplace manager, before revenues and profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;city&#34;&gt;City&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;The Pillars of The Earth&amp;rdquo;, a city and a cathedral signifies the durability of a marketplace. It provides talent, a base of customers, different entities such as a Chamber of Commerce and more. A rich ecosystem is born around the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/medieval-towns.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;medieval town ecosystem&#34; title=&#34;medieval town ecosystem&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, &lt;strong&gt;a marketplace becomes bigger than itself when it makes room for small and big actors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs allow third-party entrepreneurs to provide automation, analytics and tools for merchants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration of mailing or third-party services adds partners interested in your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-projects can create consistent and regular traffic. You can provide free budgeting tools or free project planners. You can provide free guides hosted on the marketplace. These are all the &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; stuff making your marketplace much more interesting to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why my next laptop won&#39;t be an Apple</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/laptop-machine-learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 15:35:26 EDT</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-i-apple-s-craftmanship&#34;&gt;Part I - Apple&amp;rsquo;s Craftmanship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used the original macbook, the 13&amp;rdquo; MacBook Air, the 13&amp;rdquo; Macbook pro, and 15&amp;rdquo; Macbook pros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the white plastic of the original macbook. It was better than any other computer I&amp;rsquo;ve used before, worked out of the box, and iMovie amazed me. Drag, drop, and five minutes later, you have a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/macbook_white.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;macbook white&#34; title=&#34;[macbook white]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this is what computing should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hard drive died, I got a Macbook Air. It was professional looking, impossibly thin and had a polished OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an Apple fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubled down. XCode, Final Cut Pro, Apple Aperture. A much more powerful 15&amp;rdquo; Macbook pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were the &lt;em&gt;golden age&lt;/em&gt;. Apple was the best choice in web development and creative work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OS X was the most advanced, most powerful and most reliable OS. Windows had viruses, the worst user experience with nagging dialog boxes, and always shipped with crapware. Linux was reliable, but lacked hardware compatibility and good software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OS X is a master class in UI and UX. Menus, notifications (if any), hardware integration. It seemed every detail was polished over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware was overpriced but well thought-out. It could handle dozens of Photoshop documents, xCode projects and Safari tabs, and will not crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware was deeply integrated and transparent. When everyone else taunted numbers, Apple laptops just worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All manufacturers would add software or hardware buttons and then announce an extra feature. Apple was going the other way, exploring to cut the extras. Everything was bold and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study what they have done if you want to release a technology product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-ii-apple-marketing&#34;&gt;Part II - Apple Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to put an exact date. It might be around Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; parting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priorities changed. No disruptive computing devices, just iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagging dialog boxes appeared, without any options to deactivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware and software for pros, like Final Cut Pro were dumbed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac Os X Server phased out, closing the window to OS X super computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware that could be for grandmas introduced as &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo;, such as the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various consumer devices such as the Apple Watch took more space on the home page. At the same time, &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; computing such as the Mac Pro took  an eternity to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there is an emphasis on pink and yellow gold devices, with no influence on the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you think that &lt;em&gt;Apple might just be a better marketing company than technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-iii-the-schism&#34;&gt;Part III - The Schism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is : Are Apple computers good enough for professionals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now 2016 and I spend time &lt;a href=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/post/bots/&#34;&gt;researching machine learning&lt;/a&gt;. Computation power is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most data scientists and machine learners use powerful servers or desktops for computation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have ample space to add affordable parts or expensive NVIDIA Tesla cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the startup world, laptops are kings though. There are frequent meetings in coworking spaces, coffee shops and demos in meetups. This makes laptops a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the laptop options for Machine Learners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s break the needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;memory&#34;&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with memory-mapped databases and the more memory the better. 16GB is the bare minimum, 32GB is comfortable, 64GB is better [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This already disqualifies most laptops on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cpu&#34;&gt;CPU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPU is irrelevant. Of course, the faster the better. But if there is more budget, it&amp;rsquo;s better to put it in hard drives or RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-drive&#34;&gt;Hard drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solid state drives with good throughput and high IOPS are a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a good hard drive, you can do many experiments every day and iterate quickly to a good model. With a slow hard drive, your only option could be model design during the day. Then you have to let the training run for a whole night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gpu&#34;&gt;GPU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good GPU is the workhorse. Most of modern non-trivial machine learning or statistics libraries are done by a GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet on NVIDIA with the latest CUDA drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone intends to implement their own library from scratch or if they have a project that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use CUDA, then Radeon &amp;amp; OpenCL can be a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to check the RAM available on different models. A good NVIDIA card which can load in its 8GB DDR5 RAM all the data will chew through your data. Another NVIDIA card with a good GPU but with only 1GB RAM will have to swap through slow memory leaving you frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;os&#34;&gt;OS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most machine learning and stats libraries are generally poorly supported on Windows, if not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few such as the Torch improvements developed by Facebook work on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others (popular libraries on Github) work better on OSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-iv-my-next-laptop&#34;&gt;Part IV - My Next Laptop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the requirements above, here are options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low Budget:&lt;/em&gt; I can go with a thin client (a 12&amp;rdquo; macbook, a linux laptop) to SSH into Linux GPU AWS instances. OK in most situations but lacks versatility and could be more expensive than owning an expensive graphics card in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mac:&lt;/em&gt; Macbook pros can have 16GB RAM and best-of-breed hardware. However, they can only have an AMD Radeon graphics card which is a big No. Even the powerful Mac Pro only has AMD cards. Why Apple? If you absolutely need an OSX platform, you could get a second hand macbook pro with a Nvidia GT 750M, like I did six months ago. It is still far from an ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC:&lt;/em&gt; With &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s recent announcements of Linux support in bash&lt;/a&gt;, I consider PC laptops are now a viable choice. For the best performance for the money, there are gaming laptops built by &lt;a href=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/post/cuda/&#34;&gt;Clevo, Sager, AORUS&lt;/a&gt;. Razer also sells the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth&#34;&gt;Blade Stealth&lt;/a&gt;,  a thin client that can work with an external GPU. Imagine having a Titan or a Tesla in the external box. Dell and Asus also have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/alienware-graphics-amplifier?c=us&amp;amp;cs=19&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;s=dhs&amp;amp;sku=452-BBRG&#34;&gt;a similar external box to house NVIDIA cards&lt;/a&gt;. These external boxes are interesting however they are very few reviews. I would therefore looking into &lt;em&gt;Lenovo Laptops&lt;/em&gt; such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/&#34;&gt;the T460p&lt;/a&gt; which have a dedicated nvidia GPU. These laptops are known for their reliability, guarantee and excellent Linux support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that &lt;strong&gt;there are no options from Apple for developers working in machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is not just a problem for machine learning but also for photographers and videographers who need graphics acceleration in Adobe Premiere or in BlackMagic resolve. NVIDIA cards are a requirement for Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Mercury Engine and can save hours in editing and post-production. This is why my next laptop won&amp;rsquo;t certainly be an Apple laptop but one running Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A test of patience</title>

      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note : this article usually goes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://klaio.com/en/users/1/collections&#34;&gt;KLAIO&lt;/a&gt; with beautiful photographs but (1) I do not have photographs and (2) there are comments relevant to tech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other country, Canada has its share of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It prides itself in having the lowest corruption in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true in my experience. Federal workers are polite and helpful but they will not deviate in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most of the time, service is efficient and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there are times when it is horribly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting times in clinics and hospitals can be hours, if not days. Even an urgency can mean waiting for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is hard to explain when half of the government&amp;rsquo;s budget goes into health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mystery is immigration. Applications carry the dreams of hopeful families and individuals throughout the world. They have paid a good sum of money and went to extra lengths to supply required papers and credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But months will pass before they will hear a word from Immigration Canada. The envelope is opened with excitation, husbands and kids are called, and already a few are day dreaming about maple leaves and pictures with Canadian mounties. What a shock to read in the letter that Immigration Canada has opened the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maple leaves dream darkens. Was the application lost and found by the post service? How does it take 3 months to open an envelope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did they know that the vast majority take between 6 months and 2 years from applications to the final immigration visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, you can think of document digitizing, optical character recognition and powerful databases to process applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine the main issues are verifying that individuals are who they claim to be (authentication), that they have clean backgrounds, and that said individuals will have a chance in a Canadian province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fair to state Immigration Canada has massive archives of applications coming from all over the world. There should be also data on the results of analysis and the success of immigrants in Canada. A good machine learning system can correlate the cases [1], and then predict future applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open envelope. Digitize documents. Get prediction from system. It should not take more than a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person with good human judgement can follow-up and can decide to &lt;em&gt;overturn&lt;/em&gt; the system&amp;rsquo;s prediction, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done in airports to sort out good travellers and potential criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seems Immigration Canada is still using a good old technology, namely eyes and hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. I did not mean to discuss technology but peaks of bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be reminded of the bureaucracy, once in a while, like the last time I went to the &amp;ldquo;Régie de l&amp;rsquo;Assurance Maladie&amp;rdquo;. This is where you ask for your RAMQ health insurance card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting at the RAMQ is torture for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is like being in an international airport and see diverse faces from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a Chinese mother running after her young kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An arabic couple go through their papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian girl was messenging her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of French students were arguing about culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two French-speaking africans were happy to meet again and speaking loudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face after face, row after row, you think that for a moment, all humanity was in a Montréal building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this was everyone&amp;rsquo;s patience test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posters and high-definition screens taunt maximum waiting times of thirty minutes. Yes, you will get your RAMQ card in 10 business days! And you can email or phone if you are not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited forty minutes. I smiled to the Romanian-born employee. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s for a renewal. No, he does not know about ElectronicBox, my Internet Service Provider. No, I do not have other proof of residence with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I insisted. Finally, his coworkers confirmed it was indeed a &lt;em&gt;legit&lt;/em&gt; Internet provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took a picture, and my adventure was finished for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canadian provinces, a health card allows you to see a doctor or get medicine without paying full cost. Without it, you will have to fill form after form, and many services will simply be not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I went to the office in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later, I received a letter asking for a proof of residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know if there was a typo in the previous document or if the employee from Québec city did not know about ElectronicBox. Maybe it got lost? But I know that three months is rather long to open a file and realize a proof of residence cannot be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would get angry about this. I don&amp;rsquo;t. Every country has its idiosyncrasies and this is just how Québec and Canada is [2]. You learn what matters (healthcare and taxes) and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Other countries will make a big deal about culture, or land ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To each its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I have sent since then an invoice from the electricity company. The company is owned by the government of Québec, and I guess they must have heard of it. It is now late March and I do hope I will get the card before I move out 1st of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] See &lt;a href=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/post/bots/&#34;&gt;previous post on bots&lt;/a&gt; to read about machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Don&amp;rsquo;t mistake me, Canada and Québec are amazing countries. &lt;em&gt;Qui aîme bien chatie bien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why bots are a thing now</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/bots/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing about Facebook and Microsoft efforts to deploy bot platforms, a friend reacted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bots are a thing now? I programmed bots 20 years ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a successful technology entrepreneur and has developed systems on many platforms. I can understand him. There were tutorials in kids&amp;rsquo; magazines on writing a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; bot on MS-DOS 20 years ago. More impressive were the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) found in games like Warcraft 3 or Command &amp;amp; Conquer. Friends would spend countless nights trying to beat the A.I. For everyone else, it would be the Clipper found in Microsoft Word. It had personality and would show tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, bots and A.I. were rule-based. &amp;ldquo;If player produces infantry, produce infantry-killing robots&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;If user clicks print, show links on how to print&amp;rdquo;. To get user satisfaction, you need to write rules covering all cases, as well as the exceptions. It is a creative and long but easy job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s clipper or video games AI showed their limits. &lt;em&gt;Apart from clear cases, bots could not process subtle situations&lt;/em&gt;. Typing a wrong letter would leave the bot stuck for example. Using a different expression would not work. Creative players would find ways to beat the A.I. in ways unseen by video game designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, bots and A.I. seem to be commercial hype by bored journalists, like 3D movies two years ago. You can reuse old code, add a few words like A.I or &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; in a press release, and get coverage by gullible bloggers. Fast forward a few months and you get millions from investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example is not far-fetched. The majority of startups on Techcrunch do not have true technology innovation. Yet, there is true disruption. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bots-in-a-mobile-world&#34;&gt;Bots in a mobile world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In East Africa or Asia, there is prevalence of text as user interface. When the West worked on rich graphic interfaces with lush animation, text messages provides &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa&#34;&gt;mobile banking&lt;/a&gt;, mobile communication and commerce elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text messages are lightweight asynchronous. With each text, the other party can get more information and provide even better service. Ultimately, it is a transparent interface with the promise of better meaning and deeper relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text messages is also the most convenient when you are on the go. Who has time to admire rich graphics when you are walking on a busy New York city sidewalk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text messages allow you also to cut through all the decorum. Sign-up, confirm email, create profile, navigate, search, compare, view criterias, add to favorites, reserve, confirm, add shipping address, add credit card number, add billing address, confirm again. Who has patience for all that? The idea of using natural language instead of the artificial constructs of sites and apps is indeed more powerful. If rich media is more helpful, it is possible to send a link to a picture or a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/buttons.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rich interfaces in text communication&#34; title=&#34;[Rich interfaces in text communication]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text messages is also the unifying interface, from the homeless person who is using an old Nokia, the executive with the Thinkpad to the hipster with an iPhone. It is accessible, from power users to disabled groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is definitively ripe for text as the main interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advances-in-machine-learning&#34;&gt;Advances in Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, research in machine learning [1] and especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&#34;&gt;deep neural networks&lt;/a&gt; promise better handling of user requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning feeds real-world data to an algorithm and correlate them with positive or negative outcomes. After testing, the algorithm is able to predict an outcome from new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple case would be guessing the gender. A researcher would pick features such as weight and height, and can set aside data to test later if parameters are good. A good machine learning algorithm would associate a person with shorter height and lesser weight to female gender:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/rplot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gender weight height&#34; title=&#34;[Gender weight height&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using this machine learning concept in bots would provide something different from decades ago&lt;/em&gt;. Previously, &amp;ldquo;bots&amp;rdquo; could only process discrete cases. In the case of gender search, a programmer would write rules. &amp;ldquo;If height &amp;lt; 65 and weight &amp;lt; 150 pounds, then person is female&amp;rdquo;. But what about a person who is tall and lightweight?  Machine learning can cover the continuity of cases and even try guessing &amp;ldquo;out-of-bounds&amp;rdquo; cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, machine learning is in essence solving an equation and doing a series of matrix multiplications and transpositions. It is known by researchers in universities and proved useful in industry such as signal processing or basic optical character recognition. However, it never had true commercial breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until we had deep neural networks, also called deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks, inspired by biological systems, puts multiple layers together and feeds forward data. A layer would process a sub-section of the data, send forward a tiny bit of information, and little by little, the system would &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; the bigger picture. Other deep neural networks correlate the sequence of data, making sense for example of word order in a sentence. The idea of deep neural networks was interesting but not deemed practical initially due to extreme cost of computation. A traditional machine learning algorithm already needs fast computers, so how can you find a computer able to process 10, 12, or 30 layers? Graphic Processing Unit cards, such as NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s, brought however realistic training times. A gaming laptop with Torch or caffe libraries can do successful image analysis, natural language processing or beat champions in the case of Google&amp;rsquo;s AlphaGo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafting a successful a machine learning algorithm is not trivial. Deep neural networks are even more complex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are libraries like TensorFlow which makes the job easier but it still takes a PhD or at least a Master of sciences to craft an innovative algorithm, with prerequisites in computer science and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have amazing image and video processing, Natural Language Processing is still in its infancy. Lack of structured data is one of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If deep neural networks can in theory compute any function, you need diverse, extensive, and well annotated data in a field where user requests are repetitive. This is seldom the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible with current technology to process different requests, even with deep learning. For example, you cannot craft a bot good at pizza delivery requests that would also program your music playlist. This is the main reason Facebook is opening its Messenger Platform so third-parties can develop expertise in niches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a machine learning project is not guaranteed success. You &lt;em&gt;have to accept potential failure&lt;/em&gt;, when most people think you can get a technology project succeed by throwing money and time at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I can get the following with data pulled from Yelp. However it&amp;rsquo;s as much work as developing a web app to get satisfying responses from the bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/italian.png&#34; alt=&#34;Places recommendation&#34; title=&#34;[Places recommendation]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, machine learning means a focus on &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; science, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I celebrate. It is also the promise of wider technology accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-use-case&#34;&gt;Business use case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a convolutional neural network can beat go world champions, you can imagine simple and practical cases. With enough training data and smart feature selection, you could have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/bot-dentist.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dentist&#34; title=&#34;[bot dentist]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bot would check in an availability calendar, and provide triage for new customers. Success would depend on good tagging of customer interactions and offering good options that leaves little room for ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human assistant would provide better service with good empathy, but that person would not be available at 3AM when the tooth hurts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, you could rent a car or an AirBnb. The bot can go into the database of products and match with availability calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/heri/JuliaBot&#34;&gt;add background processes&lt;/a&gt;, you can also design bots searching for optimal prices and would alert users when prices go below a certain treshold. This is where you can imagine use cases not covered by mobile or web apps. Set reminders, check automatically on loved ones, work out project details with team members&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake would be crafting messages that would be personal, emotional, friendly and at times more talkative to build rapport, and why not, have users enjoy the service [2]. Tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://smooch.io/&#34;&gt;smooch.io&lt;/a&gt; can help a seamless transition between bot replies and actual responses by a human, without customers knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I am currently researching. There is already a framework to process user requests and go into a calendar and a SQL database. The proof-of-concept can also access third-party REST APIs. If you have a database of customer communications annotated with appropriate responses, we can work together to see how bots can automate and increase customer outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] A good introduction to Machine Learning is Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info?source=phoenixCdp2016AbTest&#34;&gt;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info?source=phoenixCdp2016AbTest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] The movie &amp;ldquo;Her&amp;rdquo; portrays well a bot with good rapport. For practical examples, Microsoft is already offering a bot in China &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekwire.com/2015/people-china-love-microsofts-xiaoice-virtual-companion-says-artificial-intelligence/&#34;&gt;http://www.geekwire.com/2015/people-china-love-microsofts-xiaoice-virtual-companion-says-artificial-intelligence/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming a self-taught programmer</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2016 12:55:51 EDT</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In six months I have shipped many apps, as an entrepreneur or as a freelancer. I have also contributed to open source projects and advised other projects. Yet I’m educated as an electrical engineer, not as a software engineer and consider myself largely self-taught in the area of programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Atwood : Geeks went from being social outsiders, outcasts, and rejects to.. part of the 1% power structure, with all that implies. Hard to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in Québec, there are about 7000 programmer or developer positions that are not filled every month. As a result, small and big companies are fighting to get the attention of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just in Québec. Go in Toronto, New York city or in California. It seems you can find a highly rewarding job as long as you know how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*R5FJAuwICPzY3ByLnkgpCg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Barack Obama Code&#34; title=&#34;[Barack Obama Code]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend has not gotten unnoticed. Smart people from all horizons are now learning and looking to land a job in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is for those people in arts, marketing and many other fields who are now looking for the best way to learn how to code in six months. Since time is limited, it is focused on producing practical code instead of abstract topics such as data structures or compiling. I assume however that it is just the beginning of a journey and you will have time later on to pick on formal learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-learning-environment&#34;&gt;Building a learning environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any laptop or desktop is good to learn. However, it cannot be a phone or a tablet (no programming on iPhones folks!). It doesn’t matter if it’s Mac, PC or Linux as long as you have admin access and you are able to install anything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;interruptions-kill-productivity&#34;&gt;Interruptions kill productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning programming is in a quiet environment, with little to no interruptions. Set aside at the very minimum two hours per day, ideally a good five hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-taught programming in 2015 is done with a relatively decent Internet connection. It means you can download a 50MB package without interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;learn-from-the-best&#34;&gt;Learn from the best&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to perceptions, programming is best with social feedback, so make sure that you have a mentor who can give input and review your code. The stronger the feedback, the better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also follow programmer’s blogs and read as part of your daily routine. Most don’t showcase code and instead explain how they design software or solve critical bugs, which is essential for your culture. I read Coding Horror, Daily WTF, the Netflix blog, igvita, Facebook Engineering, the Twitter engineering blog and a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;online-resources&#34;&gt;Online resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the best resources are not books but online resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any background in programming, you can start with the free resource Code Academy. It’s important to follow each lesson and take your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6A2ZnlanQElatuc-pHzyXA.png&#34; alt=&#34;CodeAcademy&#34; title=&#34;[Code Academy]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love CodeAcademy’s interactive tools. You can try new code directly in the browserYour goal should be on building a simple static site (such as this) in 2 or 3 weeks after your codeacademy course. I recommend you put your own online resume, with a few pictures, and links to your work. Pick a code editor (take a look at Atom), a graphic program, and you have the tools to ship your first site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next are either &lt;a href=&#34;http://CodeSchool.com&#34;&gt;CodeSchool&lt;/a&gt;, TeamTreeHouse or CodeAvengers. I especially like the guys at CodeSchool with their awesome service and amazing teachers, but others are also worth a look. At the end of the day, it’s important to choose one and stick to it. I would recommend at this point to pick one that has the best javascript course. Look at meteor or node-based frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional course to look at is Google’s python course for beginners. Schedule a week to learn about a SQL database, such as PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later, your goal should be on building a simple to-do list site after the first javascript course, and be able to deploy it on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;peer-feedback&#34;&gt;Peer Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montréal, there are social meetups such as Ladies Learning code. From the beginning, it’s good to attend those meetups and see what others are doing. You can get encouraged or perhaps guided in a better direction. In other cities, you can look at meetup or eventbrite to look what is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social feedback can be also in forms of freelancing. When/If you have delivered your first site, you can publish offers on Craigslist or your local small ads site on making basic HTML sites for small businesses. Having a customer will train you in project management, learn the value of code, how to deal with pressure, ship code that you have built from scratch, as well as being compensated. Of course, you will not be able to charge a lot of money but you can charge from $80 to $200 to do a simple business site with a handful of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons are a good experience. They are single day or whole weekend experiences where you are challenged to design, develop and launch an app. After 3 months on your path, it’s a great challenge to sign up as a developer, and also a good way to meet other programmers. Hackathons are exponentially more difficult than building simple HTML sites but so rewarding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the timing is right and if your progress is fast, you can apply to go to Google summer of Code, especially if you have managed to develop one or two innovative projects in hackathons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dh4aKkidVcYevooiZMvtVg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Hackathons&#34; title=&#34;[Hackathons]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also start your social programming “life” online. StackOverflow is a good place to start. When stuck on CodeSchool, you can either search the site (recommended) or ask a question and get answers from the community. A few will laugh at your lack of experience but it’s important to persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github is another major site. Start an account, browse repositories, try out frameworks, open issues and see if you can contribute. Many projects like Apache, node, Angular are also always looking for contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you contribute publicly to Github, the higher the chances to be recruited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*npcLRTMDVW2qx6PMMGMxYg.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is the account of a zealous although imaginary programmer.&#34; title=&#34;[Github]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;internships&#34;&gt;Internships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of programmers, many small businesses are looking for programming hands to help in projects. You can use the programming experience you have gathered both in freelancing and in hackathons to land a 2 months internship in either front-end development. It can be in a web agency or a new startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be challenged in your lack of experience. You will wonder how to solve specific problems. But don’t worry. Experienced programmers also have the same issues, although on another level. Make sure to learn, ask peers, find answers on programmer forums, and deliver what you are asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When following your internship, make sure to stay involved in social programming meetups. You can also start contributing to open source projects and start focusing on a specific language you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-first-job&#34;&gt;A first job?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! Nothing is more satisfying than a first well-paid job in programming. Due to your lack of university degree in Computer science or Engineering, you can forget banks, finance institutions, large companies and focus instead on small businesses. They are more forgiving. Startups especially are more focused on your immediate talent and practically none of them are asking for a formal degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-your-goal&#34;&gt;What is your goal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coding”. “Programming”. “Developing”. or “Hacking”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you hear words such as “Front-end”. “MySQL”. “node.js”. “Objective-C”. “Selenium”. “cloud server”. It seems programming has more trends than the fashion world in Milan or NYC. What’s up with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear there are always new technologies. As such, it’s more important to learn fundamentals and learning how to learn, than learning a specific set of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I recommend starting a blog and always write about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to debug, i.e. how to find errors and test software,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to optimize performance, beginning by understanding performance issues, and learning where you can gain performance boosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to design software, design algorithms and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to work with other programmers, especially in the areas of code source control, documentation, unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog will also help you “digest” what you have learnt in the past weeks, as well as establish your online brand as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have comments or other resources, feel free to leave a note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonjour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous offrons &lt;em&gt;une expertise technique pour un résultat de qualité&lt;/em&gt; dans le développement de plateformes transactionnelles, de financement, de médias:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Étude et conception fonctionnelle et technique&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Développement de solutions front, middle ou back-office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Développement d&amp;rsquo;applications iOS ou Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduite de projet sur les technologies Ruby, Javascript, Lua, et plateformes mobiles; utilisation de base de données MySQL, Postgresql, ou redis, mongodb, ElasticSearch, Solr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audit de code, de qualité et de performance des applications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatisation des tests et recettes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intégration et interfaçage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mise en production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support et maintenance évolutive et corrective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous développons de façon &lt;em&gt;lean&lt;/em&gt; et rapide, ce qui veut dire que vous obtenez votre produit rapidement et à un coût compétitif, le tout à un standard de qualité élevé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Développer une plateforme d&amp;rsquo;excellence démarre par un processus bien conçu. Ce document ou &lt;em&gt;Playbook&lt;/em&gt; décrit le processus utilisé pour tous nos projets, que ce soit les meilleurs pratiques, astuces et règles que nous avons établis au fil des années. Nous avons inclus un exemple de projet (DAMAVA) qui vous montre le processus en action. Nous encourageons les clients nouveaux et potentiels à lire ce document pour qu&amp;rsquo;ils savent à quoi s&amp;rsquo;attendre en travaillant avec nous. Ceci est un document vivant qui est régulièrement mis à jour par notre équipe à fur et à mesure que nous apprenons à mieux faire les choses, donc attendez-vous à des modifications en tout temps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;le-premier-contact&#34;&gt;Le premier contact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La plupart de nos clients sont introduits par nos clients existants, qui nous trouvent par notre implication dans la communauté startup, via les publications en ligne ou via Google. Après avoir une recherche rapide, ils entrent en contact en remplissant un formulaire sur le site ou bien en nous envoyant un courriel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Après avoir reçu la première requête, nous planifions une première discussion pour discuter du projet en détail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Est-ce que votre projet cadre avec nos compétences techniques (platforme et développement sur mesure, applications web, applications mobile, recherche et développement, intégration d&amp;rsquo;APIs externe, design) ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avez-vous un budget suffisant en accord avec l&amp;rsquo;ambition du projet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Et-ce que votre calendrier cadre avec nos disponibilités?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Après avoir confirmé qu&amp;rsquo;il y a une collaboration possible, nous parlerons plus en détail de notre culture et de notre philosophie sur le développement de technologie. Nous pouvons aussi aller en détail par rapport aux coûts et délais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si les deux partis s&amp;rsquo;entendent, nous signons normalement un accord de non-divilguation (ou NDA) pour vous assurer que votre investissement sera protégé, et nous pouvons alors démarrer le processus de développement et le processus de découverte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: Dans le projet DAMAVA, l&amp;rsquo;instigateur du projet a été introduit par la responsable économique de la Ville de Montréal, avec qui nous avons eu de bonnes collaborations. Après avoir discuté de plusieurs projets potentiels, nous nous sommes mis d&amp;rsquo;accord pour développer une nouvelle plateforme mettant en relation des aidants naturels et des personnes agées, à travers le Canada. Les compétences d&amp;rsquo;aidants naturels, leur calendrier de disponibilité, leur placement géographique, une messagerie par email et SMS, ainsi qu&amp;rsquo;une plateforme de paiement électronique devront être développés.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-phase-de-découverte&#34;&gt;La phase de découverte&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Développer une plateforme sur mesure est en soi complexe. Même les applications &amp;ldquo;simples&amp;rdquo; ont des couches de complexité cachées qui doivent être analysées et répertoriées. Cette phase de découverte permet à notre équipe d&amp;rsquo;investir le temps nécessaire pour comprendre votre application de A à Z, et d&amp;rsquo;aller à travers chaque fonctionnalité requise, user story, écran, etc. ce qui nous permet en retour d&amp;rsquo;estimer de manière plus précise le temps requis et le coût.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De manière générale, la phase de découverte inclus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;la description des différents types d&amp;rsquo;utilisateur (utilisateur courant, utilisateur secondaire, administrateur, staff, partenaire commercial etc.),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;la description des &amp;ldquo;user stories&amp;rdquo; pour les différents types d&amp;rsquo;utilisateur,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;la description des fonctionnalités majeures de l&amp;rsquo;application,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;le design de wireframe pour les pages principales de l&amp;rsquo;application,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;le choix des technologies pour le front-end, le back-end, serveur etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ingénierie de la plateforme, par rapport au traffic planifié, nombre de commandes et besoins utilisateurs,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;le calendrier détaillé de chaque section majeur de l&amp;rsquo;application et chaque étape du processus de développement de la plateforme,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;l&amp;rsquo;estimation détaillé de chaque section majeure de l&amp;rsquo;application et chaque étape du processus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;À la fin du processus de découverte, nous vous fournirons un document détaillé qui décrit tous les éléments ci-dessus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: Après notre première rencontre, nous avons planifié quelques rencontres pour avoir une meilleure compréhension de la plateforme voulue. L&amp;rsquo;idée semblait très simple, mais nous savions qu&amp;rsquo;il y avait une complexité cachée que nous devions découvrir durant le processus de découverte. Notamment, notre partenaire avait pensé aux besoins du client, mais n&amp;rsquo;avait pas pensé à l&amp;rsquo;interface d&amp;rsquo;administration nécessaire pour gérer les clients et données ou un interface utilisateur pour ceux qui commandent. D&amp;rsquo;autres questions sont aussi apparus: que se passe-t-il après une commande? comment sont servis les pages statiques? etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aperçu de l&amp;rsquo;analyse écrite après la phase de découverte:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/discovery.png&#34; alt=&#34;Conclusion découverte DAMAVA&#34; title=&#34;[Conclusion découverte DAMAVA&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;la-phase-de-design&#34;&gt;La phase de design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les meilleures plateformes ont un design excellent, tant dans la forme que dans le fond.  Personne n&amp;rsquo;utilisera l&amp;rsquo;application si elle est &lt;em&gt;laide&lt;/em&gt; ou &lt;em&gt;ardue&lt;/em&gt; à naviguer. Tous vos efforts seront alors vains même si vous avez le concept le plus extraordinaire du monde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous tenons une importance cruciale dans le succès de votre application et de votre compagnie. Avoir une plateforme populaire est aussi important pour vous que ce l&amp;rsquo;est pour nous, alors nous plaçons une haute priorité pour avoir le bon design, pour que vous ayez une application belle et fonctionnelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il arrive aussi que nous travaillons avec des partenaires qui ont déjà un design. Dans ce cas, nous l&amp;rsquo;examinerons en détail et le discuterons avec vous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Généralement, notre processus de design inclus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Développement de wireframes de chaque page de l&amp;rsquo;application&lt;/em&gt; : Les wireframes sont des sketches en noir et blanc qui montrent la mise en page. On peut voir la structure générale des différents écrans et où les boutons et contenu iront. Ils peuvent aussi décrire les interactions utilisateurs, comme drag &amp;amp; drop, clic, swipe, single tap etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Construction du sitemap&lt;/em&gt; : Quand tous les wireframes seront terminés, nous faisons un simple sitemap qui vous montre comment les pages et les sections de l&amp;rsquo;app vont interagir entre eux. Par exemple, cela va montrer quelle page sera chargée quand l&amp;rsquo;utilisateur clique sur un bouton et quand ils finissent de remplir un formulaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interface graphique et Palette de couleurs&lt;/em&gt; Ensuite nous décidons du look de l&amp;rsquo;application. Durant cette étape seront choisis la typographie, la palette de couleurs, la librairie d&amp;rsquo;icônes etc. Tout sera mis ensemble dans un guide de style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prototype interactif&lt;/em&gt; : Finalement nous important tous les mockups dans Invision App (ou une application similaire), créant ainsi un prototype interactif qui a le &amp;ldquo;look &amp;amp; feel&amp;rdquo; de l&amp;rsquo;application finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: Pour DAMAVA, un prototype interactif couvrant les préférences utilisateur, et le processus de commande était disponible. Ce prototype était alors la référence pour tout future discussion sur les travaux à rendre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voici le prototype interactif pour DAMAVA:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/prototype.png&#34; alt=&#34;Prototype DAMAVA&#34; title=&#34;[Prototype DAMAVA&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-phase-de-développement&#34;&gt;La phase de développement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La programmation est la partie la plus complexe et qui nécessite le plus de temps dans le développement logiciel. Nous commençons seulement à programmer quand la phase de découverte et de design sont finis. Ceci assure que votre budget ne sera pas perdu dans le développement de fonctionnalités et des écrans qui vont nécessiter des révisions majeurs, ou pire, qui devront être effaçés et complètement refaits. C&amp;rsquo;est mieux de faire ces erreurs dans la phase moins coûteuse de design, quand on peut changer la plateforme rapidement avec juste quelques clics de souris. Comme mentionné ci-dessus, nous ne pouvons prendre un projet sans la phase de découverte et de design (ne pas suivre ces étapes assure l&amp;rsquo;échec du projet), et nous préférons refuser une collaboration plutôt que de se mettre d&amp;rsquo;accord sur un processus que nous savons voués à l&amp;rsquo;échec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dans la plupart des projets, la phase de développement inclus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mettre en place l&amp;rsquo;environnement de développement&lt;/em&gt; Nous démarrons en mettant en place un environnement de développement, aussi bien sur nos machines que sur nos serveurs qui vous seront accessible pour voir les progrès. Cela implique l&amp;rsquo;installation de logiciels et de librairies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Développer l&amp;rsquo;architecture et la base de données&lt;/em&gt; Ceci inclus la structure de la base de données selon les outils choisis, le choix d&amp;rsquo;authentification utilisateur, création de compte, relations entre données. À cette étape, nous établissons les fondations de la plateforme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Développement des fonctionnalités&lt;/em&gt; Nous prenons un à un les &amp;ldquo;user stories&amp;rdquo; répertoriés surant la phase de découverte et nous mettons dans zenhub, notre système de gestion de projet. Nous assignons ensuite chaque fonctionnalité à un développeur, estimons le temps requis, et rajoutons les informations pour chaque fonctionnalité, ainsi que les tests nécessaires pour la validité. À fur et à mesure que les développeurs réalisent chaque fonctionnalité, nous mettons à jour zenhub, et la fonctionnalité est alors sous la responsabilité de l&amp;rsquo;assurance qualité.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assurance Qualité&lt;/em&gt; À fur et à mesure que les fonctionnalités sont réalisés, l&amp;rsquo;assurance qualité passe en revue le code ainsi que les tests pour voir s&amp;rsquo;assurer de la qualité et voir s&amp;rsquo;il y a des bogues. En plus, nous mettons en place un système de tests automatisés qui vous assurent la fonctionnalité de l&amp;rsquo;application. Nous suivons plusieurs principes qui ensemble, vous assure une couverture qualité des fonctionnalités de haut niveau du système ainsi que la qualité des différents sous-modules, aussi petits soit-ils. Avec un système automatisé, votre compagnie sera capable de développer, optimiser et maintenir le code, sans vous soucier des conséquences innattendus que la mise à jour de code peut entraîner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La livraison&lt;/em&gt; Fonctionnalité par fonctionnalité, l&amp;rsquo;application est développé. Vous pouvez vérifiez à tout moment l&amp;rsquo;avancement du projet en allant sur zenhub ou bien en allant sur les serveurs de développement, jusqu&amp;rsquo;au jour où l&amp;rsquo;application sera prête pour être lancé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: Dès que le processus de design et de découverte de DAMAVA a été finalisé, nous étions prêts pour démarrer le développement. Nous avons chargé tous les &amp;ldquo;user stories&amp;rdquo; créé durant la phase de découverte et design dans zenhub et nos développeurs étaient prêts. Puisque le projet a été bien défini durant les deux premières phases, la phase de développement s&amp;rsquo;est bien passé, avec très peu de surprises, et notre équipe a été capable de mettre en ligne la première version de l&amp;rsquo;application en 2 mois et demie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/digitalocean.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nous utilisons DigitalOcean pour héberger des instances flexibles et idéales pour le développement&#34; title=&#34;Nous utilisons DigitalOcean pour héberger des instances flexibles et idéales pour le développement&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/zenhub.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gestion des fonctionnalités à developper avec Zenhub&#34; title=&#34;Gestion des fonctionnalités à developper avec Zenhub&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-phase-de-beta-testing&#34;&gt;La phase de &amp;ldquo;Beta Testing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C&amp;rsquo;est le temps de voir comment votre application est reçue dans la &amp;ldquo;vrai vie&amp;rdquo;. La plateforme la mieux programmée aura toujours des bogues, il est donc impératif que votre application soit testée, utilisée, revue par des utilisateurs potentiels avant le lancement officiel. Les beta-testeurs incluent souvent les vrais utilisateurs de la plateforme, qui vont l&amp;rsquo;utiliser dans les mêmes conditions et la même finalité que la plateforme finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il arrive que le processus de beta soit découpé en un beta privé, où des utilisateurs spécifiques sont invités pour tester l&amp;rsquo;application, et un beta publique, où n&amp;rsquo;importe qui peut s&amp;rsquo;identifier et &amp;ldquo;jouer&amp;rdquo; avec une version beta. Ce processus peut indéniablement souligner des bogues, ainsi que mettre en avant des fonctionnalités critiques manquantes qui devront être analysés et travaillés avant le lancement final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: dès qu&amp;rsquo;une version utilisable a été développé, toute l&amp;rsquo;équipe a été invité pour essayer la plateforme et essayer d&amp;rsquo;y trouver les limites. Ceci a mis avant des bogues graphiques, des bogues de logique, des bogues d&amp;rsquo;exception ainsi qu&amp;rsquo;un design à travailler pour le navigateur Firefox et Microsoft Edge. Ensuite le client a été invité à tester l&amp;rsquo;application et nous faire en détail de leur commentaire. Dès la fin de cette étape, des aidants naturels de la région de Montréal ont été invités à tester l&amp;rsquo;application sur le terrain. Il en est sortie une liste de feedback positifs, les utilisateurs beta ayant trouvé l&amp;rsquo;application facile à utiliser et naviguer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-phase-de-lancement&#34;&gt;La phase de lancement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Après de nombreux mois de travail ardu, l&amp;rsquo;application est lancé! C&amp;rsquo;est le temps de fêter et de se féliciter! Il y a eu des moments difficiles et longs, mais c&amp;rsquo;est le but. Comme l&amp;rsquo;a dit John Kennedy : &amp;ldquo;Nous avons choisi d&amp;rsquo;aller sur la lune, non parce que c&amp;rsquo;était facile, mais parce que c&amp;rsquo;était difficile&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maintenance-un-accompagnement-au-delà-du-lancement-du-produit&#34;&gt;Maintenance : Un accompagnement au delà du lancement du produit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comme tout système complexe, les plateformes requiert une maintenance. Quand vous achetez une nouvelle voiture tout fonctionne parfaitement. Mais avec le temps, si vous ne changez pas l&amp;rsquo;huile, alors le moteur va à un moment ou un autre se déteriorer et s&amp;rsquo;arrêter de fonctioner. C&amp;rsquo;est la même chose pour tout logiciel. Le jour où votre application est 100% complète n&amp;rsquo;arrivera jamais. Un certain niveau de maintenance est nécessaire, incluant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La surveillance des erreurs et résolution des bogues potentiels&lt;/em&gt; Tout plateforme doit être suivie pour tout erreur sur une base constante. À fur et à mesure que des utilisateurs différents sont rajoutés sur le système, et que l&amp;rsquo;application est utilisé de manière différente, plus de bogues ou besoins clients vont être découverts et devront être corrigés. Nous utilisons Airbrake pour la gestion des erreurs, et New Relic pour le suivi de performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gestion des librairies&lt;/em&gt; Les applications mobiles et web modernes sont souvent développées avec des librairies en code ouvert, comme par exemple Ruby on Rails, jQuery, React, Bootstrap, Lapis etc. De plus, des APIs sont souvent intégrés pour utiliser des données externes, solutions de paiement, comptes de médias sociaux etc. Ces dépendances externes vont changer avec le temps : de nouvelles versions vont être publiés, des bogues vont apparaêtre, et les méthodes d&amp;rsquo;intégration vont changer. Par exemple, si vous utilisez Paypal, il se peut que ce fournisseur annonce une toute nouvelle façon de s&amp;rsquo;authentifier, qui invalide alors votre processus de paiement actuel. Pour avoir une application fonctionelle, vous aurez besoin de mettre à jour et maintenir ces dépendances sur une base constante.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimisation de performance&lt;/em&gt; À fur et à mesure que votre application devient populaire, la performance sera amoindrie. Les temps de chargement vont s&amp;rsquo;allonger, et la base de données devient moins responsive etc. Cela signifie qu&amp;rsquo;une optimisation continue devra être effectué.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sécurité&lt;/em&gt; Les criminels recherchent régulièrement à pirater, soutirer de l&amp;rsquo;argent, attaquer votre plateforme, ou utiliser votre plateforme pour des fins illégaux. Cela signifie qu&amp;rsquo;une surveillance continue devra être effectué. Nous offrons différents solutions, selon le type d&amp;rsquo;application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exemple: Après la livraison d&amp;rsquo;une application fonctionnelle, un forfait de maintenance incluant l&amp;rsquo;hébérgement, la résolution de bogues, la maintenance logicielle et l&amp;rsquo;optimisation a été offert au client, qui peut donc se concentrer sur les besoins d&amp;rsquo;affaire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://studiozenkai.com/images/airbrake.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nous utilisons Airbrake pour le suivi des erreurs&#34; title=&#34;Nous utilisons Airbrake pour le suivi des erreur&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;développement-continuel&#34;&gt;Développement continuel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Après que les clients utilisent votre plateforme pour des besoins concrets, vous pouvez vous rendre compte qu&amp;rsquo;ils vous manquent des fonctionnalités. Il se peut aussi que ce soit des fonctionnalités critiques et qui doivent être rajoutés &lt;em&gt;tout de suite&lt;/em&gt;. Il est donc important d&amp;rsquo;avoir un budget de développement continuel. Encore une fois, les meilleurs plateformes sont celles qui sont toujours en développement, et ne sont jamais parfaitement finies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;un-projet-et-coût-maîtrisé&#34;&gt;Un projet et coût maîtrisé&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comme vous l&amp;rsquo;avez peut-être deviné, la conception d&amp;rsquo;applications sur mesure est un processus complexe qui requiert une collaboration entre des professionnels différents. C&amp;rsquo;est courant d&amp;rsquo;avoir des projets incluant :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;un gestionnaire de produit qui s&amp;rsquo;assure que la plateforme répond aux besoins clients, interface avec les développeurs, et coordonnne l&amp;rsquo;assurance qualité&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;un designer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;un développeur front-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;un développeur back-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selon la complexité du projet, ce nombre peut être restreint à une équipe de deux personnes, ou à l&amp;rsquo;inverse peut se rajouter un gestionnaire de projet, des développeurs back-end et mobile supplémentaires, et des personnes en assurance qualité.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avec notre expérience, nous avons développé le processus de gestion de projet que nous utilisons sur chaque projet. Il est conçu pour augmenter la productivité et maximiser le retour sur votre investissement, et aussi pour vous permettre d&amp;rsquo;être au courant du projet. Vous pouvez vous attendre à:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Un seul point de contact&lt;/em&gt;. La dernière chose que nous voulons est que chaque personne de votre équipe et chaque personne de notre équipe passent leur temps à communiquer et parler de la même chose. Pour rémédier à cela, c&amp;rsquo;est mieux d&amp;rsquo;avoir un seul point de contact de votre coté, et un seul de notre coté, à travers lequel toutes les échanges sont faites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Une rencontre hebdomadaire&lt;/em&gt; Vous êtes impatient d&amp;rsquo;avoir votre application et vous voulez la publier. Tous les jours, vous voulez donc savoir:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qu&amp;rsquo;est ce qui a été fait aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qu&amp;rsquo;est ce qui a été réalisé hier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Que sera fait demain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puis-je voir?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quand est-ce que ce sera fini?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous comprenons. Nous sommes aussi impatients aussi. Mais voici le bémol. Toutes ces discussions, appels et emails prennent beaucoup de notre temps, distraient l&amp;rsquo;équipe, diminue votre budget, et aussi rendent les choses plus lentes et non plus rapides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous voulons être respectueux de votre temps et de votre budget et nous voulons nous assurer que vous restez maître du projet. Ainsi, chaque lundi nous aurons des rencontres de vive voix ou en vidéo avec vous et votre équipe, où nous allons en revue ce qui a été réalisée la semaine précédente et ce qui est planifié pour être complété la semaine courante. De cette façon, vous savez toujours ce qui se passe et où en est le projet, et nous vous répondrons sur une base hebdomadaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceci signifie aussi que les emails, appels téléphoniques, messages textes, et chats devront être évités en dehors des rencontres hebdomadaires du lundi. Bien sûr, il y aura toujours des développement critiques qui engendreront des exceptions à cette règle, mais de façon régulière, nous préférons suivre ce plan pour que le projet avance comme prévu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Démonstration&lt;/em&gt; Dans ces rencontres, une partie du temps sera réservée à vous montrer le travail réalisé jusqu&amp;rsquo;à présent. Le travail reste disponible sur les serveurs de développement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outils de gestion de projet&lt;/em&gt;. Nous utilisons une panoplie d&amp;rsquo;outils pour la gestion de projet pour améliorer notre vitesse et qualité. Voici les outils les plus utilisés:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenhub pour le suivi de développement, collaboration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype/Google Hangout pour les rencontres vidéos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack pour chat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invision App pour visionner les écrans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs pour le travail sur Excel, Word, Powerpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvest pour le suivi précis du temps de travail et comptabilité&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notre-philosophie-de-développement&#34;&gt;Notre philosophie de développement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;méthodologie-lean-et-mvp&#34;&gt;Méthodologie Lean et MVP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous croyons au principe de développement lean&amp;hellip; ce qui signifie tout simplement le développement de la version la plus simple possible d&amp;rsquo;application, aussi appellé MVP ou Produit Minimum Viable. Le MVP inclut seulement le coeur et les fonctionnalités critiques de votre application, et rien d&amp;rsquo;autre. Cette approche est la plus rapide et qui vous rapporte le plus en matière de retour sur investissement, pour que vous puissier obtenir du feedback et apprendre des comportements utilisateurs &lt;em&gt;AVANT&lt;/em&gt; de rajouter des fonctionnalités secondaires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent, non? Nous comprenons que nos clients veulent contrôler leur coûts, et en même temps proposer le meilleur produit sur le marché. C&amp;rsquo;est pour cela que nous collaborons de près avec nos clients pour s&amp;rsquo;assurer que la vision MVP soit bien consistant auprès de chaque membre de l&amp;rsquo;équipe. Notre expérience a montré que plus l&amp;rsquo;offre initiale est &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo;, mieux sera le retour sur investissment au long terme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pourquoi cela? Parce que vous n&amp;rsquo;ajouterez pas de fonctionnalités superflues, qui bien que étant une très bonne idée initialement, n&amp;rsquo;était pas finalement celle que vos utilisateurs voulaient. Pourquoi allez-vous dépenser de l&amp;rsquo;argent sur des fonctionnalités qui sera envoyé à la poubelle? Nos clients ont trouvé que c&amp;rsquo;est mieux de démarrer lean et de dépenser de l&amp;rsquo;argent seulement sur des fonctionnalités sur des &lt;em&gt;besoins prouvés&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;改善-faire-le-meilleur-produit-possible&#34;&gt;改善 : Faire le meilleur produit possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous tenons à faire le meilleur produit possible chaque jour. Nous améliorons de façon continue nos pratiques, notre efficacité personelle, et tenons à éliminer tout ce qui est superflu. C&amp;rsquo;est la philosophie 改善 ou Kaizen qui fait de nous des artisans du code passionnés.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;travaillons-ensemble&#34;&gt;Travaillons ensemble !&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenant que vous comprenez notre processus de développement et notre philosophie génerale et approche pour développer des plateformes réussis, discutons ensemble de votre prochain projet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cuda Cores Ranking for Machine learning</title>

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA graphic cards can be used to accelerate &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries&#34;&gt;scientific computing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&#34;&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, video games and occasionally bitcoin computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video editing and post-production also benefit greatly from NVIDIA cards with Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Mercury Engine or BMD&amp;rsquo;s Davinci resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of scientific computing, performance is directly proportional to the number of cuda cores. As long as cpu speed is &amp;gt; 2GHz and you have as much RAM as you have GPU RAM, you are all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this lists current top 10 laptops that have a good price vs cuda cores # ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;caveats&#34;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for top performance, building a rig with a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Tesla-Graphic-Card-900-22081-2220-000/dp/B00AA2C1DC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1444533616&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=Nvidia+K20X&#34;&gt;Nvidia K20X&lt;/a&gt; or Nvidia &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-GAMING-Graphics-12G-P4-2990-KR/dp/B00UVN21RQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1444534649&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=geforce+titan+x&#34;&gt;TITAN X cards&lt;/a&gt; is more economic with the benefit of having a supercomputer in your hands. It is also possible to just use a cheap gpu-less laptop and upload data to a &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; computing service such as mindori or our friends from fuzzy.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On SLI configuration, most neural networks processes will not use the SLI bridge and will just parallelize calculations as if it had 2 discrete gpu devices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffe (UC Berkeley) : &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/1148&#34;&gt;parallelization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theano (University of Montréal) : &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Theano/Theano/wiki/Using-Multiple-GPUs&#34;&gt;use of SLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Torch (NYU). It is difficult to use both gpus at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
