        <h1>Dokomaps</h1>
        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 1, 2019</span>
        <p>Aimable D. is a close friend since our engineering school days. Like me, he spent time in the corporate world. But he has also done multiple ventures, from eCommerce to corporate to consumer ventures.</p>
<p>Now he is focused on <a href="http://dokomaps.com">dokomaps</a>, along with Jules, who worked previously with him on other <a href="http://mobayilo.com">ventures</a>. I am reviewing today Dokomaps to provide feedback, to showcase a good product, but also in the hope that Aimable reviews one of my current ventures, such as <a href="http://outcomereference.com">OutcomeReference</a> :)</p>
<h2 id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h2>
<p>Please take the time to visit the <a href="http://dokomaps.com">site</a>. It describes well what you get. Signing up is straightforward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I get from it:</p>
<p>Dokomaps lets you favorite places, local or international, in personal lists. The list can be for personal use, but they are designed to be shared to the widest audience. Think &ldquo;TOP 10 BEER PLACES&rdquo; or &ldquo;Top vacations places&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The purpose is simple and will resonate in most people.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created two lists. The first is <a href="https://dokomaps.com/map/176/montreal-for-kids">Montreal for kids</a>, divided in the outdoor and indoor categories. The second is the <a href="https://dokomaps.com/map/29/montreal-tech-map">Montreal tech map</a>. Creating those two lists were quick. I was able to add any place I could think of. The application finds the geographical coordinates, pictures and then zooms the map on the places. You can also re-order places, so I assume the first ranked place is the best of the category. Is this great or what?</p>
<h2 id="the-value">The Value</h2>
<p>My immediate value is sharing those lists and getting feedback from friends/family about places I&rsquo;ve missed. I can&rsquo;t think of any other app that provides this now. Or a Google Maps option somewhere?</p>
<h2 id="wishlist">Wishlist</h2>
<p>Previously, I thought visitors needed to have an account to view lists you&rsquo;ve just made, making sharing difficult. However, it turned out there are two different URLs, one for you as owner of the list, and another one for sharing. As a user, there was no reason for me to think that there would be a different URL for sharing. This could have been solved by making the sharing URL much more visible, or alternatively, change the structure of the website so there&rsquo;s only 1 URL.</p>
<p>This might appear like a small thing, but I believe this illustrate what dokomaps can improve upon generally. While the user experience is generally good and the product is usable, there are multiple areas that can be perfected, kaizen-style.</p>
<p>I also thought people who&rsquo;ve signed up should have an option to comment or add their feedback on the list. Otherwise the &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; will migrate outside Dokomaps, such as Facebook or Twitter, which is too bad.</p>
<p>I also wish there was an option to mark a place as done. For example, if I plan to visit X places, I can use dokomaps and check every place as soon as I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>As a final point, I like this venture. It&rsquo;s always refreshing to see a new take that&rsquo;s not done by Google or Facebook, and knowing your data won&rsquo;t be analyzed, ingested and then sold back to you. If Google was doing this, they would know even more about you than you did, and we don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
