        <h1>All I want for Christmas is a small phone</h1>
        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 10, 2018</span>
        <p>I got an iPhone 6S Plus a few years ago. I was impressed by the screen, the biggest I’ve had. Look! I can use it as a tablet. Watch videos everywhere, or showcase my latest work at a tech meetup.</p>
<p>The dreams shattered in many pieces. I was biking happily, the phone was sticking out of my pocket and crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>I bike a lot, hike, run around hilly tracks and never cracked a screen before the iPhone 6S Plus. Previous phones could fit in a normal pocket. In an instant, I realized why large screen phones did not work for me.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone 6S Plus, electronics manufacturers seems to compete against each other in size. More screen real estate, more cameras.</p>
<p>I do not want big screens anymore. Even today, I do not know how to hold it when I run or exercise. Do you keep it on your hand? Or buy a special attachment and put it on your shoulder? I run for peace of mind, and having a big dangling phone seemed to defeat the purpose.</p>
<p>I get in a similar akward situation when I meet friends for lunch. When phones are big, you do not want to keep it in a pocket. It finishes on the table. This separates us. The phone becomes a talking point and becomes part of your identity.</p>
<p>I also use my phone for two factor authentication. This means the phone is the key for assets worth $10k - or $5k depending on cryptocurrency prices… I don’t want to put such a key asset on a table.</p>
<p>The tools I like best are forgettable when I do not use them, are user friendly, and do not require special treatment. And they definitively do not define my behaviour. This is not the case of phones with 6 inches display.</p>
<p>So for this Christmas, I will go against the grain to want less, not more.</p>
<p>What I want:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 inch would be a good size to start with. I could forget in my pants pocket. I could put it in my runner shorts and go run for a couple of hours, without noticing the weight. 6 inches would not fit in those short shorts.</li>
<li>Make it waterproof, dust-proof and a minimum shock-proof so I don’t have a heart attack when a baby plays with it.</li>
<li>Fingerprint sensor. Please, no face recognition. Showing my face doesn’t mean I want to unlock it.</li>
<li>Headphone jack</li>
<li>Large camera (1/2.3 to 1”) with computational photography.</li>
<li>Ideally, an expandable phone, such as being able to connect it to a raspberry pi.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don’t want:</p>
<ul>
<li>a phone made of glass or other luxury material. In the real world, a phone falls, is a toy for kids, is covered by sweat when you run, and bumped against coins and metal keys. And it not an object I am willing to replace by the latest trendy gizmo every 18 months.</li>
<li>a notch</li>
<li>a phone that costs $1000.</li>
<li>an assistant that spies your browsing history, your location or your audio to serve ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this somehow describes an iPhone 5S with an upgraded camera, with the durability of a Nokia 3310. I would get one. Wouldn&rsquo;t you? Let’s hope a product manager hears this somewhere.</p>
